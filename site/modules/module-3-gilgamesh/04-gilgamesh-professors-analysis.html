<h2>Tablet of Gilgamesh Analysis</h2>

<p>At its core, Gilgamesh is the first and prototypical "Heroes Journey," so it should come as no surprise that this text deals explicitly with the idea of “heroic systems.” The Ninevite version of the epic begins with a prologue in praise of Gilgamesh, who is two-thirds divine and one-third human, the great builder, warrior, and knower of all things on land and sea.</p>
<p>This is similar to what Christian theologian Blaze Pascal says about humanity, “Man is neither angel nor beast and unhappily whoever wants to act the angel acts the beast.” Gilgamesh's conflict is a central conflict of our species, and when we meet him, he is very much the beast.</p>
<p>In books like The Hero with a Thousand Faces and The Power of Myth, Campbell reports on the deep structure of narrative that he found while comparing the myths and legends of many cultures using inductive reasoning. “The Hero’s Journey” was his all-embracing metaphor for the deep inner journey of transformation that heroes in every time and place seem to share: a path that leads them through great movements of departure, initiation, and returns. All these stages are divided into three larger sections. The first part, the Departure, includes the following stages:</p>
<p>The Status Quo</p>
<p>The Call to Adventure</p>
<p>Assistance</p>
<p>Departure</p>
<p>The second part, the Initiation, includes the following stages:</p>
<p>Trials</p>
<p>Approach to the Innermost Cave</p>
<p>Crisis</p>
<p>Treasure</p>
<p>Result</p>
<p>The third part, the Return, includes the following stages:</p>
<p>Return</p>
<p>Resurrection</p>
<p>When we first meet Gilgamesh, he is a bit of a bastard. Power, it seems, has corrupted him, and his people cry out for help. The gods answer and Enkidu are born. Enkidu is Gilgamesh's equal, and in a sense, he "tames" Gilgamesh in the same way Shamhat tames Enkidu's impulses. There is one key difference in those impulses, however: Enkidu's are fueled with purpose and compassion, whereas Gilgamesh's are selfish and cruel. Why?</p>
