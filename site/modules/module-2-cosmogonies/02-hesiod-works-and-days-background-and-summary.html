<h1>Hesiod, Works, and Days</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Hesiod Portrait</p>
<p><em>Works and Days</em> is one of the earliest sources of Greek religion and culture that still exists. Hesiod was probably roughly contemporaneous with Homer (another author we will study) who wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey. The consensus is that Hesiod was a real person; however, the works attributed to Hesiod almost certainly contain additions from later writers, which represent cultural ideas or things that occur after Hesiod’s lifetime.</p>
<p>Hesiod lived some time in the late 8th to mid-7th century B.C.E. B.C.E. stands for  “Before Common Era” and is the same as “B.C.,” so remember, when we are talking about B.C. or B.C.E., the numbers go backward. Autobiographical information from Hesiod from his poetry reveals to us that he was the son of an immigrant to the Greek Peninsula; his father immigrated there from elsewhere. Hesiod was a Shepherd by trade and lived on or near Mount Helicon where he was visited by the <strong>muses</strong>: the divine beings that Greeks believed to inspire all music, art, and stories. They visited him while he was working as a Shepherd and inspired him to become a poet. We also know that he was successful as a poet. </p>
<p><em>Works and Days</em> is a mythical history of humanity but is also a very <strong>didactic poem</strong>: a poem that instructs either in terms of morals or by providing knowledge of philosophy, religion, arts, science, or skills. It is about the proper ways of life and the way that we should live life. It is important to note that Hesiod did not invent or originate the stories mentioned in his poetry. Instead, he seems to be closer to the later period or the end of a tradition. Therefore, his work is a synthesis or a combination of long-established preexisting stories that people would have been familiar with. What is essential is the way he put them together.</p>
<p>In his works, he talks about the gods, so we need to know a bit about Greek religion. Greek religion was <strong>polytheistic</strong> rather than <strong>monotheis</strong><strong>tic</strong> like Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. Followers of the ancient Greek religion believed in multiple divine or supernatural beings. The religion is also <strong>syncretic</strong> as<strong> </strong>ancient Greeks combined religious traditions from many different sources and cultures that they met, resulting in the existence of multiple beings associated with the same objects or ideas. For example, in both Artemis and Selene, two different meanings are associated with the moon. There are many other examples of this, giving way to the many different conflicts and competitions between various gods over rulership. This may mirror, in some ways, the historical conflict between different cultures as they came together. </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><em>Works and Days</em> is primarily a <strong>didactic</strong> poem meant to instruct morals and behavior to the common person – the farmer, the worker, the everyday person. So, this is about human affairs far more than it is about cosmological affairs, one of the things that differentiates it from Hesiod’s other work, the <em>Theogony</em>. It is a mix of moral and ethical as well as practical advice. The framing of <em>Works and Days</em> is Hesiod addressing himself to Perses, his dissolute wayward brother, as Perses attempted to take more than his fair share of their father's inheritance by bribing the local rulers through trickery and guile. Hesiod admonishes him for his lack of discipline, his laziness, and his cheating nature. While Hesiod repeatedly tries to instruct him in virtue, the poem is not directed only to Perses. It is through Perses that Hesiod addresses all those who wish to know right from wrong. </p>
<p>One of the most important themes of <em>Works and Days</em> that we see early on is the decline of humanity. Hesiod lists the various ages of man while saying that this present era, <em>the one in which he lives</em>, is the most degraded. Humanity, to Hesiod, has lost its virtue, and as a result, we must suffer and toil. Labor is what the modern man must endure, and there is no hope. The great beings of the past are dead and gone, and our lot is only going to be suffering and toil with no possibility of escape until death.</p>
<p>The two cardinal virtues that Hesiod champions in <em>Works and Days</em> are <strong>justice </strong>and <strong>work</strong>. He says that justice is necessary for any possibility of peace and prosperity. <em>If there is prosperity without justice, there can be no peace</em>. Attempting to define what justice means, Hesiod attempts to go beyond just human law and says that there is some universal principle that defines justice. Work, on the other hand, is the lot of all humans because of our degraded nature. We must work to survive, but there is also goodness in work. The honest worker, the person who works hard, works right, and earns well through that manner, will achieve blessings and glory, while the one who achieves work through cheating or violence will ultimately be punished.</p>
<p>Hesiod revisits the story of Zeus and Prometheus from his previous work, <em>Theogony</em><em>,</em><em> </em>but in <em>Works and Days</em> Hesiod speaks about different aspects: the focus is on Pandora, the first woman, who is sent as punishment for humanity because Prometheus stole fire and gave it to humans. Furthermore, there is an excellent description of just how beautiful Pandora is and the great attributes that she has all in juxtaposition with her negative aspects and all the suffering that she brings into the world by opening Pandora’s jar or, depending on the translation, Pandora's box – a famous story that many have probably heard. </p>
<p>Hesiod then moves to describe the ages of men. First, there is the Golden Age, and these human beings lived a carefree life without pain or suffering. </p>
<p>We should note that Pandora does not come until later in the ages, although it is not entirely clear when she shows up.</p>
<p>The Golden Age was all men living in peace and abundance, but for some reason, they all died. </p>
<p>After this, we get the Silver age, the second generation of men, and they also lived carefree lives. Hesiod describes these men as childlike, almost as spoiled, and he says they were very reckless and violent. <em><strong>They refused to honor the gods</strong></em>, and for this, they were punished and killed off. </p>
<p>Next is the Bronze Age; these are humans of great strength and violence as well as being dreadful and mighty. Their weapons and tools were all made of bronze, and he describes them as being consumed by violence and warfare. </p>
<p>The Bronze Age gives way to The Heroic Age. They are similar in many ways, but the Heroic Age is better and <em>more </em><em><strong>j</strong></em><em><strong>ust</strong></em> than their Bronze predecessors. These are the great heroes of Greek legend, the heroes of the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>: Achilles, Hercules, Perseus, and Odysseus. </p>
<p>Finally, we get to the Iron Age, the modern world, of which Hesiod wishes he were not a member. He explicitly describes how his contemporaries have declined in their morals and ethics. Neighbors do not help each other; people do not honor the gods; the Kings take advantage of their subjects, and subjects defy their Kings; children defy their parents, etc. This is an age of decline and loose morality, and Hesiod says that this age, too, will eventually be destroyed.</p>
