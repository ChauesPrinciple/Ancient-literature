<span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>, a major founding work of European literature, is usually dated to around the <strong>8th century B.C.E.</strong>, not the 7th century. It is an epic poem written in Ancient Greek but assumed to be derived from earlier oral sources, and tells a section of the legendary Trojan War between the Achaeans (as there was no “Greece”) and the city of Troy, in Asia Minor. The poem itself centers on the figure of Achilles, the greatest of the Greek warriors, his quarrel with King Agamemnon, the Achaean leader, the death of Achilles’ friend Patroclus, and Achilles’ ultimate defeat of the Trojan warrior Hector, in vengeance for slaying Patroclus. The quality of the writing, the thoughtful treatment of warfare, and the thematic interest of the material have made the <em>Iliad</em> the most influential early work of Western literature, certainly from the time of the Renaissance onwards. <strong>Modern archaeological investigation, especially by Heinrich Schliemann, has substantiated Troy’s location and importance,</strong> though the historicity of the events remains debated.</span>
<p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Although Homer's <em>Iliad</em> is the text that most people associate with the Trojan War, it is not the story of the “Trojan War” but one of <strong>Achilles’ rage</strong>. We are in the region of modern Greece, very similar to when we talked about Hesiod, but we are a little further back in time. While the events described in <em>The Iliad</em> happened <strong>several centuries earlier (circa 1200 B.C.E.)</strong>, the text itself was written in the <strong>8th century B.C.E.</strong>, sometime between 750 and 700 B.C.E. This doesn’t mean Homer lived 150 years, but rather that the exact dates of his life and works remain a matter of debate. In the debate on whether it was Hesiod or Homer who came first, it usually swings toward Homer being the older of the two, but they were writing around the same time, at the beginning of the rise of the Greek city-states, which would culminate in the fifth century B.C.E. cities of Athens, Sparta, and Thebes. Homer lived during the <strong>Archaic Period</strong>, not the Iron Age (as noted in Hesiod's works). <em>The Iliad</em> describes an earlier <strong>Bronze Age society</strong>, where most of the weapons and armor are made from <strong>bronze</strong>. Bronze is easier to smelt, meltdown, and reforge, although it is softer and easier to damage than iron. <strong>Iron technology existed</strong> but wasn’t yet commonly used in the type of weaponry described in <em>The Iliad</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">During the <strong>Bronze Age of the Iliad</strong>, the eastern Mediterranean was dominated by three superpowers: the Egyptian Empire, the Babylonian Empire, and Mesopotamia, which would later be replaced by the Assyrian Empire of the same area, and then the <strong>Hittite Empire</strong>, which became a major player around the <strong>17th century B.C.E.</strong> We also talked about Gilgamesh and that it has also been trading with these other empires. We have clay tablets coming from the Hittite Empire, specifically from the city of <strong>Hattusa</strong>, which was its capital. One of those tablets is composed of fragments of the middle Babylonian <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>, which dates back to around <strong>1500 to 1300 B.C.E.</strong> So, this was a major literate empire. Unfortunately, we may not have heard of it as much as the Mesopotamians and the Egyptians because it is not described in the Bible. We have a couple of Hittite references, but these are single individuals because they had disappeared as a power by the time the Bible was written.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">The <strong>Hittite Empire</strong> is located on the peninsula of modern-day Turkey. At the time, it was called <strong>Anatolia</strong> before it was Turkey. Moreover, at the western edge of this landmass, where it meets the Aegean, there was a city that the Hittites referred to as ‘<strong>Wilusa</strong>,’ a name related to the Greek ‘Ilios’/’Ilion,’ Homer’s other name for Troy. During the <strong>late Bronze Age (1750–1180 B.C.E.)</strong>, the city was by far the most important settlement in the area, but it was still only a small player on the world stage. Towards the end of the Late Bronze Age, Wilusa was a small <strong>vassal state</strong> of the mighty Hittite Empire of Anatolia. The word “Ushuaia” also shows up in Greek, and it is where we get our modern word: Asia. The term “Ushuaia” itself originally refers to this place, this western end of Anatolia, and it is later that it began to be called <strong>Asia Minor</strong>, which implies that everything east of it is the larger Asia.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 20px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Summary</span></h2>
<div>
<p>The <em>Iliad</em> tells the story of a war fought between the city of Troy and its allies against a confederation of Greek cities. The conflict began when <strong>Paris</strong>, son of <strong>King Priam</strong>, abducted <strong>Helen</strong> from <strong>King Menelaus’s</strong> kingdom. The Greeks raised an army to fight for Helen’s return and sailed to Troy to win her back by force, but we do not see any of this in the <em>Iliad</em>. That is because <em>The Iliad</em> is a small part of the overall story.</p>
<p>There are a total of <strong>seven texts</strong> that make up the entire Trojan War:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cypria</strong> (Preamble: Paris, Helen, and the first Nine Years),</li>
<li><strong>Iliad</strong> (Achilles’ Rage),</li>
<li><strong>Aethiopis</strong> (Achilles takes the arrow to the heel),</li>
<li><strong>Little Iliad</strong> (Odysseus and the construction of the Trojan Horse),</li>
<li><strong>Ilious Persis</strong> (Troy is destroyed),</li>
<li><strong>Odyssey</strong> (Nostoi comes first, everyone but Odysseus journeys home, and Agamemnon gets axed),</li>
<li><strong>Telegony</strong> (In the final chapter, Odysseus is killed by his illegitimate son).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our story, then, is only about one thing: <strong>Achilles’ rage</strong>. The story begins with a priest asking the leader of the Achaean army to release his daughter, <strong>Chryseis</strong>, from slavery. <strong>Agamemnon</strong> refuses, and so the priest, Chryses, prays for help. He gets it in the form of a plague on the Achaean army.</p>
<p>The plague ravages the Achaean army, and they ask the prophet <strong>Calchas</strong> about it, and he tells them to return Chryses’ daughter. Agamemnon agrees to this reluctantly but demands compensation in the form of <strong>Briseis</strong>, the girl given to Achilles as a slave by Agamemnon himself.</p>
<p>Achilles is enraged by this demand and refuses to fight for him any longer.</p>
<p>Achilles, the greatest fighter of the Achaeans, wants revenge on Agamemnon. He asks his mother <strong>Thetis</strong> to ask <strong>Zeus</strong> to help them win the war against Agamemnon and his men. Achilles is fated to die a glorious death in battle, so if they succeed, it will give him glory and make him more famous.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Paris and Menelaus agree to duel to end the war between the Trojan and the Achaean forces. Paris is defeated, but the Trojans attack anyway. The Achaean army fights back, with many soldiers distinguishing themselves, and the tide of battle turns several times before the Trojan forces finally push the Achaeans back toward their ships. Meanwhile, a proxy war is being waged between the gods: <strong>Athena</strong>, <strong>Hera</strong>, and <strong>Poseidon</strong> support the Achaean forces, while <strong>Apollo</strong>, <strong>Aphrodite</strong>, and <strong>Ares</strong> support the Trojans. Zeus decides to end the war by himself, so he helps engineer a Trojan advance against the Achaean forces.</p>
<p>The Achaeans are fighting the Trojans, but they have lost their leader, Achilles, and without him, they are in dire shape. He is not cooperating with them because he now only cares to protect his Myrmidons. The Achaeans ask <strong>Nestor</strong> – an older man who has fought many battles – to convince Achilles to return to battle so that they can get back home safely. However, even though Nestor is very persuasive, he fails at convincing Achilles because his honor does not allow him to give in.</p>
<p>Achilles’ companion, <strong>Patroclus</strong>, wants to take Achilles’ place in battle because he is worried about the destruction of the Achaean forces. Eventually, Achilles agrees, and Patroclus dons Achilles’ armor. When Patroclus leads out the army dressed as Achilles, he frightens all of Troy. He fights well and drives back the Trojans. However, when Patroclus disobeys orders by going after <strong>Hector</strong> instead of returning home after defeating the Trojan forces, Zeus allows <strong>Apollo</strong> to knock down Patroclus so that Hector can kill him on the ground without armor or a weapon.</p>
<p>Achilles’ grief over Patroclus’ death is so immediate that he wants to go back home. Grief quickly transforms into rage, and Achilles decides to rejoin the war instead. Thetis goes to get the shield from <strong>Hephaestus</strong>, who makes it for Achilles. Meanwhile, the Trojans stay outside their city walls because they think Achilles is not as strong without Patroclus. Achilles kills many of them on the plains of Troy while wearing his new armor and using his new shield. The Trojans are frightened by Achilles and run inside the walls of Troy. Hector is the only one who stays outside. Achilles kills Hector and then drags his corpse behind a chariot as revenge for Patroclus’ death.</p>
<p>Achilles grieves over Patroclus’ death by holding an elaborate funeral for him, which is followed by a series of games in his honor. After the games, Achilles continues to drag Hector’s body around Patroclus’ corpse for nine days. <strong>The gods send Hermes</strong> to escort Priam to ransom Hector so he could be buried properly. It is Priam’s plea to Achilles that reminds Achilles how much it hurts when someone dies before their time. Achilles is finally able to grieve truly, and he assents to give Priam Hector’s body.</p>
