<h1>The Inferno</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Dante and Virgil</p>
<p>Dante Alighieri, the author of <em>The Divine Comedy</em>, was born in Florence, a northern Italian city-state that was central to his political and spiritual stance. Around 1300 C.E., Florence, like many Italian city-states, was caught in a large-scale confrontation between those who thought the Papacy and the church should possess absolute power and those who thought that the city-state should be independent of the Papacy. Alighieri wrote about this conflict in <em>The Monarch</em><em>ia</em>, which was promptly banned for seeking to place limitations on the political power of the church. This ban was not lifted until 1881.</p>
<p>These two parties were referred to as the Guelphs (who supported the Pope) and the Ghibellines (who supported the Holy Roman Emperor). Unfortunately for Dante, the Guelphs became dominant within the city of Florence. There was, however, a schism in the Guelph party: The Black Guelphs continued to support Pope Boniface VIII, and the White Guelphs had come to despise his despotism. Naturally, Dante sided with the White Guelphs. However, while he was in Rome, the Black Guelphs seized power of Florence and banned Alighieri from reentering Florence in pain of being burned at stake. This sentence was not revoked until 2008, and Alighieri was never able to return home. </p>
<p><em>The</em> <em>Divine Comedy</em><em> </em>is made up of one hundred <strong>cantos</strong>, which are divided into three sections of thirty-three. The extra canto is the introductory canto at the beginning of <em>The Inferno</em>. This numerological structure is reflected in the landscape as well: Hell is divided into nine circles, each containing a different category of a sinner, each with its unique punishment. The constant play on the number three and its cube (3x3) highlights the Trinitarian theology underlying the structure of the entire <em>Comedy</em>.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Layers of Hell</p>
<p>Our story begins with just Virgil, the guide, and Dante as they begin at the gates of Hell inscribed with, “Abandon all hope ye who enter here.”</p>
<p>They pass the gate and enter what is called ante-Inferno, which is before “we” reach what is called the layers of Hell. This area is designed for people who have had the choice between good and evil and could not choose, so they have been rejected by both Heaven and Hell. These prisoners are constantly tormented and chased by hornets and snakes, forcing them into action. There are Angels here as well, those that chose neither side in the war of good versus evil. They are also tormented.</p>
<p>Virgil and Dante come to a great River, which serves as the boundary of Hell and where many souls wait for a boat ride from Charon, who appears in Greek mythology on the River into Hades. You will notice a lot of Greek and Roman mythology seeping into this poem as we go on. Charon crosses with the duo, and we encounter the first real circle of Hell. This circle is called Limbo. The souls here are “virtuous pagans.” They have done great deeds, lived morally good lives, but either did not accept Christianity, lived long before it existed, or were never baptized. God granted passage of a few figures such as Noah and Moses to enter Heaven, but it is phrased as a rare occurrence. This is where Virgil, other poets, and philosophers exist, so that Virgil will return here after their adventure. There is no physical punishment but rather a general sadness that they are so close to Heaven but forever kept outside.</p>
<p>The second circle of Hell they approach houses those guilty of lust. These are those that gave in to pleasure and are now cursed with eternity amid a raging storm wind; it is strong enough to whip some about uncontrollably, ravaging them against the rocks.</p>
<p>The third circle of Hell continues to rain, but now it is filth raining from the sky, and those that were gluttonous and consumed in excess lay on the ground unable to move, forever pelted with debris and sewage. In this level, Dante also sees the monster Cerberus prowling. In Greek mythology, Cerberus is the three-headed dog that keeps souls in Hades. Interestingly, Dante continues to mix mythology and religion here.</p>
<p>Like those that were gluttonous, the fourth circle is dedicated to those who suffered the sin of greed. Here we find a demon named Plutus, who in Greek mythology was the God of money and wealth. The greedy are forever battling each other, rolling giant boulders into each other in a constant jousting match. There is no reprieve from the battle.</p>
<p>The fifth circle is against a giant river, the River Styx, where the wrathful and angry are kept fighting each other forever, clawing and biting in anger. The sullen and gloomy are also kept here, submerged under the water and forced to breathe and choked on the black mud.</p>
<p>Withdrawing further from the world, Virgil and Dante cross the River and approach the lower half: the worst of the worst. There is a city here, and it is guarded by fallen Angels, who turn Virgil and Dante away: “No living man may enter Dis!” the fallen angels’ shout. This is the first place where Virgil holds no sway or influence and may not be able to protect Dante. However, a messenger from Heaven arrives and tells these Angels that they should open the gates, and they reluctantly obey.</p>
<p>Virgil and Dante enter the sixth circle of Hell. They find themselves walking into a graveyard with tombstones covered in flames: here lie the heretics, or those who promoted other false religions, or the rejection of religious and political “norms.”</p>
<p>The Seventh Circle is home to violence, and there are many types. </p>
<p>The outer ring is for those who are violent to others, like murderers and warlords. </p>
<p>The middle ring is for those who are violent to themselves committing acts of suicide. </p>
<p>Lastly, the inner ring is for those that are violent against God, such as blasphemers against God and violence against nature and God's creation. </p>
<p>Virgil and Dante meet and ask a creature named Geryon to take them to the 8th circle of Hell. This beast is a symbol of fraud, as he is the face of a man who tricks you while he stings you with his scorpion tail. In this story, he has massive wings and flies our heroes to the next level, which is for fraud itself. Within the eighth circle is another called the Malebolge (“Evil Pockets”), which houses ten separate bolgias (“ditches”), with demons torturing people all around those that have deceived and manipulated others during their life; this includes pimps and sexual manipulators, as well as gamblers and people who created false money. We also have fortunetellers with their heads placed backward, so they can only see behind them. These punishments are terrifying yet apt to their crimes.</p>
<p>In the final circle of Hell, we have Satan himself: a giant 3 headed beast that is forever flapping his giant wings. Contrary to popular belief, this level of Hell is frozen, and most of Satan’s body is encased in ice. He is forever punishing the three greatest betrayers in history: Judas, who betrayed Jesus Christ, and Brutus and Cassius, who betrayed Julius Caesar. There are other men wholly frozen in ice, those that have betrayed their family, their God, or their country. As an author, Dante makes some sharp criticism in these last few circles, including referencing political parties and real people. They all exist in the deepest bowels of Hell for what they (maybe) did. Virgil grabs Dante and they climb down Satan’s frozen body until they end up at his feet, which is now somehow turned upside down. Down has become up.</p>

<h2>Analysis:</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Satan in Hell</p>
<p>For the sake of this course, we are going to read <em>The Inferno</em> differently: </p>
<p>as a personal account of a universal journey. </p>
<p>This, of course, begs the question: what kind of journey? While the theological connection to Christianity is obvious, <em>The Inferno</em>, especially in consideration of the entire <em>Divine Comedy</em>, can be read as a guide <strong>to manifest</strong><strong> a healthy, psychologically balanced mind</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, we need to talk a little about trajectory and geometry. Wait, is this not a literature course? I get it but let me explain. First, a <strong>comedy</strong>, in the Greek sense, does not mean “something that makes us laugh.” What it does explain is the trajectory of the story:</p>
<p>A comedy moves from a place of conflict (like waking up in Hell) to a place of fulfillment (like arriving in Heaven). In a sense, we can call a comedy a story with a “happy” outcome. </p>
<p>In Dante’s understanding of geometry, the human trajectory, or the direction that we move, is <strong>linear</strong>. It may help to think of how we experience time to understand Dante’s point: we are born, we make decisions, we are held accountable for those decisions.</p>
<p>Angels, however, always move in a circular trajectory because they exist outside of time; this can be seen both in the movement of the fallen angels throughout the text (constantly circling) and the punishment of Satan. When we consider these two trajectories together, both linear and circular, we are presented <strong>with the physical structure of hell itself</strong>: a spiral, funneling to the point of contention. </p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, we also need to understand how this text was meant to be understood from a theological perspective. According to Thomas Aquinas, there are four ways that every theological text (in the Christian tradition) must be read.</p>
<p>Historically or Literally</p>
<p>E.g., Moses’ exodus from Egypt in the Bible. This is considered a historical event, where the Jewish people were removed from bondage on a literal level.</p>
<p>Allegorically</p>
<p>E.g., Moses’ exodus is also understood as an allegory for how Christ will lead humanity out of “moral” bondage.</p>
<p>Morally or Tropological (in the now)</p>
<p>E.g., Moses’ exodus, mirrored in Christ’s promise, is meant to be applied to the reader of the Bible at the moment: they are supposed to exit their moral bondage through personal choice.</p>
<p>Anagogical</p>
<p>E.g., Moses’ exodus is also mirrored in revelations, as “all humanity” is removed from the bondage of this plane of existence and enters the “promised” land.</p>
<p>Thus, with one story (Moses’ exodus from Egypt), the audience is presented with four ways of understanding that story. Dante expects the same of us as we read the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. </p>
<p>In this way, if we read <em>The Inferno</em> with the theological framework Aquinas had in mind, every reading of the text, <em>aside from the historical</em>, not only can but should be applied to the reader, both in the present and in the future. </p>
<p>While we are on the subject of reading the text historically, however, we should clear a few things up: due to the inclusions of Dante's "political enemies," some critics view <em>T</em><em>he Inferno</em> as a pseudo fan fiction, where Dante punishes those he disagrees with. </p>
<p>Also, like a few of the texts we are going to study this semester, Dante made a radical choice in his choice of composition: he wrote the Divine Comedy in the “common” language of the time (Italian), rather than the “educated” language (Latin). </p>
<p>Why is that a big deal? </p>
<p>Well, most people did not know how to read Latin! Those that could were not common people, and they considered Latin to be the only viable language for those properly educated. So, if the "people" had no understanding of Latin, and all literature of the time had been recorded in Latin, could the "common" person understand all those literary references we do, e.g., Tristan and Isolde, or Achilles, Paris, and Helen (we will meet them soon)? Naturally, the answer is no. They would, however, understand all those current political references. It is always important to remember the audience. Furthermore, it is imperative for the logic of The Inferno that whoever is reading can understand the inferences because <strong>Dante use</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> “Type to Anti-type” and “Figure Fulfillment” </strong><strong>to build his allegory</strong>. The only real difference here between <strong>figure fulfi</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>lment</strong> and the <strong>Anti-Type</strong> is one of time and direction. The story of Isaac and Abraham is a biblical story that demonstrates figure fulfillment, as the sacrifice of his son would mirror and foreshadow God’s sacrifice of his son in the future, whereas Pope Celestine V is the Anti-Type for all cowards that preceded him. Here are some related examples: </p>

<p>The Crucifixion</p>
<p>The Anti-type of all Cowards</p>
<p> before him (e.g., Pontius Pilate)</p>
<p>(Examples of the anti-type?)</p>
<p>(Political Betrayers) </p>
<p>Ulysses (XXVI)</p>
<p>Now that all the complicated background is out of the way let me outline what this work is about: <strong>the will</strong>. More specifically, Dante’s journey is about the weakness of the will and how to obtain <strong>syndesis</strong> between the will and reason. To put it simply: </p>
<p>Does having, knowing, or understanding the definition of justice makes you just? </p>
<p>Then it is a problem of the will.</p>
<p>Syndesis is concerned with one’s reason and one’s will being joined: that what one says is the right thing (adultery is a sin), and what one does (not committing adultery for any reason) are the same. It is also worth noting that, through the geometry discussed above, it is also apparent that Dante based the structure of Hell on a common practice at the time: Labyrinthian meditation. Author DeAnna Evan’s puts it this way:</p>
<p>“Just as Theseus, without the guidance of Ariadne’s thread, would have been entangled in the labyrinth at Crete, hopelessly lost, facing certain death, so Christians would become entrapped and lost in this world, unable to attain salvation, without the divine grace extended by Christ. This grace was the thread by means of which the faithful negotiated their way through a sinful, perilous world, ultimately triumphed over evil, and reached Paradise, symbolized by the defeat of the Minotaur in the myth and by reaching the centers of the church labyrinths.”</p>
<p>The Inferno is a labyrinth of the mind; it is a labyrinth in which we are meant to confront the gap between our reason and our will and achieve syndesis. </p>
