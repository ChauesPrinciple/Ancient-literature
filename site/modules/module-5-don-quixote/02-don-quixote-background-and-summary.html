<h1>Don Quixote</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Don Quixote and Sancho</p>
<p>We are going to be discussing one of the most important and influential works in all classic literature: <em>The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote de La Mancha</em> by Miguel de Cervantes. A little background on the author himself: Miguel de Cervantes was born on or around September 29th, 1547. Not a lot is known about his early life; it is theorized the young Miguel studied under the Jesuits, learning to read and write. His father was a Hidalgo, a part of the nobility; the family itself was poor, and we do know that Miguel ultimately left Spain in 1570. As a result of disagreements with local law enforcement, young Miguel had wounded a man in a duel. Making his way to Italy, he joined up with the Spanish forces stationed there. While there, he fought in the naval battle of Lepanto in 1571 against the Turks. Cervantes served with distinction despite injuring his left arm, a wound that would plague him throughout the remainder of his life. He continued to serve for the next five years until 1575. He was ultimately furloughed and was making his way back to Spain when, despite having served with the military for five years, Miguel was captured by Barbary Pirates and taken to Algiers to serve as a slave for another five years. Miguel attempted to escape three times but was unsuccessful each time.</p>
<p>In 1580, he was finally ransomed and did make his way back to Spain. It was at this point that he began to write plays, and because he was ultimately unable to make his living through his pen, he a job as a tax collector in the province of Andalucía. Tax collecting proved to be just as unpopular a job in the 1580s as it is today, and a young Cervantes wound up in several tussles and disputes. He served time in jail several times. It was while he was imprisoned in Sevilla that he wrote the introduction to the first part of Don Quixote and came up with the idea for his ingenious Hidalgo. Don Quixote appeared before the public in 1605, the first part having been printed in 1604. The book proved successful and sold out several printings. Cervantes spent the following ten years in crafting the second part of his famous novel. Unfortunately, before Miguel could publish his genuine second part, a false second part of the adventures of Don Quixote appeared before the public in 1614. The book was written under the pseudonym of Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda. Cervantes published his actual second book shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>In Don Quixote, Cervantes draws attention to how the imagined “realities” of chivalric legends gained credibility in Spanish society and literature. Instead of indicating their fictitious components, chivalric romances often presented themselves as historical accounts and referenced other well-known sources to add realism to the imagined “realities” they created. In the prólogo to Don Quixote, Cervantes complains “to a friend” that he does not have enough learned references for anyone to take his story seriously.  His friend replies, telling Cervantes, “no hay más sino que vos procuréis nombrar estos nombres, o tocar estas historias en la vuestra, que aquí he dicho, y dejadme a mí el cargo de poner las anotaciones y acotaciones” (12) “all you have to do is to manage to quote these names or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to me to insert the annotations and quotations” (Ormsby 12). The author also prefaces his story with sonnets and letters from fictitious persons of importance.  Cervantes mimics both the <strong>archetypal</strong> tale of the chivalric knight with his tale, as well as how writers of chivalric tales would fabricate many references to produce ethos. By filling the physical reality of his novel with a prólogo full of references to the Bible and antiquity and fictitious sonnets and letters, Cervantes invites his readers to read the work as a parody of the mythos of chivalric culture and books of chivalry.  </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Part 1 – 1605 </p>
<p>When the story finally opens, we meet the protagonist, a man named Alonso Quijano. This guy is old, and he is not your typical protagonist; we do not get his actual age, but we will say he is sixty or so, about the age of our author. For the 16th century, that age would be well into the nineties in modern life expectancy. He is described as old, scraggly, and tall. Quijano spends all his time reading books, and not just any books: Romantic novels with the Knight Errant hero, in shining armor, and the damsel in distress. He spends his days obsessively reading these books. The narrator intones that Quijano has lost it, or at least, according to those around him. He is to the point that not only does he read the books all the time, but he starts to believe that they are real and that he himself is a Knight in shining armor.</p>
<p>Thus convinced, he decides that he is going to fully embody his role as the Knight in shining armor and go out into the world and live out the stories in his books. The first story is about how he gets ready to go out into the world: he commandeers his grandfather or great grandfather’s armor (from a time when the Knight Errant was a significant part of Spanish society); this old, rusted armor has green oxidation all over it, and he twines it together with string. He tries to test how durable it is, so he runs with this Lance that he also picked up from his grandfather’s stash, and the armor crumbles apart. He ties it up again with more string (and maybe some duct tape, or whatever the equivalent duct tape was in the 16th century), and this time he does not even try to test it. This demonstrates the depth of Quijano’s delusion. He cannot test it anymore because if he sees it is falling apart, he is going to start falling apart. </p>
<p>When Don Quixote arrives at the inn, he thinks that it is a castle, and the prostitutes are beautiful maidens. The dwarf opens the drawbridge for him to enter his imaginary world. Everyone in the inn laughs at him because of his ridiculous thoughts and actions except for one man who decides to play along with Quixote’s imagination and knights him so that he can leave immediately without hurting anyone else.</p>
<p>The innkeeper advises Don Quixote that knights need to carry some extra clothes and money. On his way back to La Mancha, he hears someone crying from a bush. He discovers Andres, who says that John Haldudo the Rich is whipping him for no good reason. The master claims that Andres owes him unpaid wages, but Andres insists that the master is lying about this. Quixote sides with the boy against his master and thinks justice has been served when the master agrees to pay him promptly. However, once Don Quixote leaves, it becomes clear that justice has not really been done at all because Haldudo continues beating up on poor Andres.</p>
<p>Every Knight must possess three things: an appropriate name, a big noble steed, and the most important, a fair maiden with an appropriate name. Don Quixote de La Mancha is born. La Mancha is a place in Spain, but La Mancha also means stained, so Cervantes is suggesting naming him Don Quixote to mean “of the stained one”, or of the marked one, which will be important to the Analysis. He has a horse, but here is the problem: his horse is not a noble steed but a work horse. He is not only a workhorse, but he is also an antique. Finally, a knight needs a proper lady in waiting to dedicate all his victories to. He knows a woman in town whose name is Aldonza Lorenzo. While this sounds like a nice name, back then, it was the equivalent of a “commoner,” so he knows that she is going to need a better name. When Quixote is extolling his deeds to everyone and other knights ask what his lady's name is, it must be proper. Thus, Aldonza Lorenzo becomes Dulcinea del Toboso.</p>
<p>Don Quixote has returned to his home in La Mancha, but he still believes that he is a knight. His niece and the others try to convince him otherwise, but they cannot. When they discuss which, books need to be burned, Don Quixote interrupts them. Specifically, Don Quixote is upset because they have blocked his entrance into the library. After Don Quixote is put to bed, the housekeeper burns all the books. Shortly after leaving again, Don Quixote meets a man named Sancho Panza, when Don Quixote realizes that he needs a squire because all the nights in old Romance novels have a squire who accompanies them. He therefore convinces Sancho to join him as his squire. Sancho Panza follows Quixote because Quixote promises him an island to rule. Sancho Panza, who is Quixote’s foil, is in many ways the exact opposite of Quixote: he is a short, fat, and little man who rides a donkey. Later in their adventures, the duo come into a field full of windmills, which, off in the distance, Don Quixote has mistaken for giants. He turns to Sancho Panza and commands him to charge the giants with him. Sancho, of course, disagrees. Quixote is quickly defeated by the windmill after attempting to charge it with his lance. Quixote looks at the whole situation and immediately comes up with a new story. He says that a wizard must have enchanted these Giants to look, act, feel, and behave physically like windmills. In this scene, we see how far Don Quixote is willing to go.</p>
<p>The two continue their adventures, which are incredibly funny but also have dark satirical undertones. In one of them, he attacks a group of monks, thinking that they have imprisoned a princess; in another, he battles a herd of sheep. In almost every encounter in the first book, Don Quixote, Sancho, or both end up being beaten. In one such encounter, we meet a shepherdess, Marcela, who refuses to be courted or married despite her beauty, which makes all men angry at her for rejecting their advances. Don Quixote listens to all the lonely shepherds who have been rejected by Marcela. However, there is a twist: Marcela shows up in person to flatly reject everyone’s argument, saying that God has created her beauty, so he is responsible for giving her such an amazing gift while at the same time making sure nobody takes advantage of it. Marcela continues to argue that although many men may have fallen in love with her because of her looks, it does not mean that she owes those men her body or life simply because it is their desire. Quixote, notably, sides with Marcela. Later, Don Quixote acquires a metal washbasin from a barber, which he believes is a helmet once worn by a famous knight. He frees a group of convicted criminals at the end of this encounter. There is usually a victim whose lives Quixote is trying to change, and some whose live he does change, because he is living this fantasy life of valor and knighthood. </p>
<p>Don Quixote subsequently encounters Cardenio, who lives wild and, in the woods, because he believes that Luscinda, the woman he loves, has betrayed him. Don Quixote decides to imitate him to prove his love for Dulcinea is just as great and sends Sancho to deliver a letter to her. When Sancho stops at an inn, he finds two of Don Quixote’s old friends, a priest and a barber, who are looking for him. They decide that one of them should pose as a damsel in distress to try to lure Don Quixote home. En route, they come across a young woman, Dorotea, previously betrayed by Don Fernando, who married Luscinda. Dorotea agrees to pretend to be a princess whose kingdom has been seized by a giant, and Don Quixote is persuaded to help her. They stop at the inn, where Don Fernando and Luscinda soon arrive. Luscinda is reunited with Cardenio, and Don Fernando promises to marry Dorotea. These complicated telenovela-style digressions carry an essential message about wealth, class, and freedom.</p>
<p>Later, the priest and the barber put Don Quixote in a wooden cage and persuade him that he is under an enchantment that will take him to Dulcinea. Eventually, they return him home.</p>
<p>Part Two – 1615 </p>
<p>Part two finds Don Quixote a month older and eager to set out on his third sally, but this time many of the characters have already read the first part of Don Quixote’s adventures and know about Don Quixote. He learns from a student named Carrasco, who becomes his antagonist, that his adventures thus far have been recorded in a very popular chivalry romance, which has made him and Sancho very famous. Within a few days, Quixote and Sancho set out for El Toboso to obtain Dulcinea’s blessing. Nevertheless, neither of them knows where Dulcinea lives. When they are confronted by the reality that there is no such person – only a peasant girl named Aldonza, Quixote becomes convinced that Dulcinea is under an enchantment that has turned her into an ordinary peasant girl.</p>
<p>When they get back on the road, Quixote battles with the Knight of the Forest, who is Carrasco in disguise, trying to trick Quixote into returning to the village. Quixote wins the battle, and Carrasco skulks away in dishonor. Don Quixote and Sancho then meet a duke and duchess who are prone to shenanigans. In one such ruse, they persuade the two men that Sancho must give himself 3,300 lashes to break the curse on Dulcinea. The duke later makes Sancho the governor of a town that he tells Sancho is the isle of Barataria. There Sancho is presented with various disputes, and he shows wisdom in his decisions. However, after a week in office, he decides to give up the governorship.</p>
<p>The two friends continue to meet many interesting strangers. They become friends with a gallant captain of thieves and a wealthy nobleman in Barcelona. Quixote battles with a mysterious Knight of the White Moon, who, again, turns out to be Carrasco. This time, Carrasco wins the battle and, as his prize, demands that Quixote and Sancho return to the village. Quixote grows sadder and sadder and begins to lose hope of Dulcinea’s disenchantment. When they return to the village, Quixote becomes very sick. One day, after a long sleep, he announces that he has regained his sanity. He now scorns knighthood and detests chivalry romances. There is no more Don Quixote; he is Alonso Quijano again, and, soon afterward, he dies.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Don Quixote</p>
<p>“It is not doubted, but certainty, which drives us insane.”</p>
<p>Nietzsche – Ecco Homo</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must address that this text, often credited with being the first novel of the Western world, is also the first meta-fiction.<strong> </strong><strong>Meta</strong><strong>-fiction</strong> is not easy to define; however, although characteristics of metafiction vary as widely as the spectrum of techniques used within them, a pattern of several common traits can be traced.  These techniques often appear in combination but can also appear singularly.  Metafiction often employs intertextual references and allusions by:</p>
<p>examining fictional systems,  </p>
<p>incorporating aspects of both theory and criticism,  </p>
<p>creating biographies of imaginary writers,   </p>
<p>presenting and discussing fictional works of an imaginary character. </p>
<p>Authors of metafiction often violate narrative levels by:</p>
<p>intruding to comment on writing,  </p>
<p>involving his or herself with fictional characters,  </p>
<p>directly addressing the reader,  </p>
<p>openly questioning how narrative assumptions and conventions transform and filter reality, trying to prove that no singular truths or meanings exist ultimately.</p>
<p>Metafiction also uses unconventional and experimental techniques by: </p>
<p>rejecting conventional plot,  </p>
<p>refusing to attempt to become "real life,"  </p>
<p>subverting conventions to transform “reality” into a highly suspect concept,  </p>
<p>flaunting and exaggerating foundations of and the instability of their ideas,  </p>
<p>displaying reflexivity (function which enables the reader to understand the processes by which he or she reads the world as a text).  </p>
<p>Another overarching theme of Don Quixote is the blending of reality and fiction, both in the real world in which we live and the fictional world in which Don Quixote lives. In the case of Don Quixote, it is impossible to discuss the real-world events behind the book without delving into some of the themes of the book itself because Cervantes himself blends reality so effectively. By the end of the book, even the reader does not know what truth or fiction is. Don Quixote, the character, himself is perceived as being a madman, although he is also described as being very sane. For example, there is a clear contrast between Don Quixote’s perception of roadside Inns as castles, of himself as a Noble Knight errant, and the fact that he is often remarked as being philosophical and wise when remarking on any subject <em>except</em> for knight-errantry. This duality of Don Quixote provides the basis for the blending or blurring of reality itself.</p>
<p>One of the first and most notable uses of this blurring technique comes from the author of the book, <em>and by </em><em>the </em><em>author</em><em>,</em><em> I do not mean Miguel de Cervantes</em>, although he was the man who wrote the text. He claims in the prologue to the first part of Don Quixote that he is not, in fact, the “father” of Don Quixote; he is the stepfather, merely stumbling across the manuscript and translating it. Thus, he acts not as the actual creator but simply as the messenger. Now, this narrator becomes a character within the book itself and will be separated from the action described within the text; however, he often remarks upon it, noting several passages as being apocryphal, commenting upon the narrative itself, why he translates certain things the way he did, or why he puts certain parts of the book in certain places.</p>
<p>Now, this narrator character even goes so far as to further distance himself from the actual author of the story by saying that he only found the first eight chapters of the manuscript. At the beginning of chapter nine, he says that he ran out of manuscripts and ultimately tells a long-winded tale of how he came across the rest of it. He stumbled upon the notebooks and loose leaves of paper comprising the manuscript accidentally and bought them from a local. The manuscript was written in <strong>Arabic</strong>, however, which the narrator character does not speak. The narrator, “Cervantes,” describes going to the local cathedral and finding an Arabic <strong>moor</strong> to be able to translate the rest of the text. Thus, he is not even the translator anymore; he is just the Messenger. He does continue to act as a character within the book. </p>
<p>If that was not enough to blur the lines of the reality of who on earth is writing this text, Cervantes offers himself up as an actual named person within the book! At the end of the first part of Don Quixote, there is a character known as the captive, and his story, or “The Captives Tale,” tells of his being captured on the Mediterranean by Barbary Pirates and taken to Algiers, serving as a slave. The captive makes the escape of his own accord, though, something Cervantes was never able to achieve. Cervantes was ransomed, however, and all these experiences harken back to Cervantes’ own. He weaves his own story into the text, even going so far in the tale of the character to name himself as one of the officers involved in the original scuffle. His full name was Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, and the captive makes mention of having served with an officer Saavedra, so Miguel de Cervantes ultimately injects even his person and his namesake into the book.</p>
<p>It gets even stranger. The first part of the book, which Miguel de Cervantes published in 1605, ultimately becomes the <strong>M</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>cGuffin</strong> <strong>device</strong> that moves the narrative within the second part of the book. Early in the second part of the book, Sancho Panza comes to Don Quixote and says that he ran into a man in town who says he has heard of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The reason that he is familiar with their adventures is that he has read them in a book. Within the book, Don Quixote says to Sancho that he must summon this man to him. Samson Carrasco enters the story and becomes a prominent character within the second part of the book. Carrasco says that he read the first part of the adventures of Don Quixote. All the characters that Don Quixote meets in the second part of the book are familiar with him already because they too have read the adventures of the first part of Don Quixote. The book that we are reading is the device in the book that we are reading! It is upside down.</p>
<p>Cervantes’ initial (overt) purpose is to satirize the romances of chivalry, to create a parody of a literary type characterized by supernatural deeds of valor, implausible and complicated adventures, duels, and enchantments. The literature that expresses the medieval spirit of chivalry and romance has degenerated by Cervantes’ time. </p>
<p>His method of showing the inherent silliness of chivalric romances is </p>
<p>“to show what extraordinary consequences they would lead a man insanely infatuated with them, once this man set out to live ‘now’ according to their patterns of action and belief.”</p>
<p>In addition to chivalric romances, Cervantes parodies the pastoral novel in the section about Marcela, the shepherdess who is unmoved by her shepherd admirers.</p>
<p>Don Quixote is known for being a satire, which means it employs irony, exaggeration, ridicule, or humor to provide a criticism of something. It is not just one satire, however; it is two competing satires in the same story. We have the main story: Don Quixote, his exploits, and how they affect the people around him, and then there is another encompassing super story on top of it. Miguel de Cervantes tries to enforce the idea that the story is actual history by narrating through the voice of a fictional Moorish translator. These characters, and apparently Cervantes himself, harbor overwhelmingly negative opinions of the romantic literary traditions of Spain, specifically the books of chivalry we mentioned earlier. In the words of Cervantes’ friend, the author's purpose in writing this story is the fall and destruction of that monstrous heap of ill-contrived romances, which though abhorred by many, has so strangely infatuated the greater part of humanity.</p>
<p>To say that Don Quixote is a satire and leave it at that would be a terrible disservice. Here is why: <strong>Satire</strong> is not a genre so much as it is a style. It is also important to note that in contemporary terms, the word satire is often best known as a type of comedy, but it does not have to be.  George Orwell’s <em>1984</em>, for instance, is a far cry from funny, but it is providing criticism.</p>
<p>Looking at the hyper vitriolic language Cervantes uses to describe romantic literature; it is easy to assume that Don Quixote is a satire of the books of chivalry. However, if we read closely, we will notice a contradiction: there is a disparity between the authorial input and <strong>the subtext</strong> of the story itself. Don Quixote is Cervantes’ representation of Spain’s romantic traditions. Quixote often appears to be inept, ineffectual, even minorly harmful in some cases, but the result of his adventures is positive. He brings lovers together, provides simple entertainment to a great many people, as well as helps his closest and most involved friend – his squire Sancho Panza – to discover himself and embraces his place in the world. Quixote becomes a genuinely sympathetic character by the novel's end, and the cruelty of his audience, represented by the Duke and Duchess, becomes the subject of criticism.</p>
<p><strong>Juven</strong><strong>alian </strong><strong>Satire</strong> is a satire that attacks its subjects with personal invective and general cynicism. It seeks change through outrage, attacks superfluous academic jargon, and can be seen in the (outer) frame of our story, where Cervantes has provided fake reviews for his own work.</p>
<p>Juvenalian satire style was named for an early Roman poet Juvenal, whose work criticized figures and institutions of the time through personal invective, angry moral indignation, and general cynicism. Juvenalian satire attacks its subject to incite change through outrage. This style of satire is crucial in understanding Don Quixote because, through metafiction, the Juvenalian satire comprises the bulk of the story's first layer of satire. Throughout both the first and second parts of the novel, Cervantes interjects, in the guise of fictional narrators, a relatively stark perspective on the state of Spanish literature at the time. Cervantes draws particular attention to the romanticizing of Chivalric texts at the time by juxtaposing Cervantes’ hyper vitriolic tone toward Chivalric texts with the emphatic praises of his metafictional translator (which is also him); this stark, biting criticism creates the first half of the book's fascinating satirical dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Horatian Satire</strong> is a satire that uses indulgence, tolerance, amusement, and wit to make the <strong>reader</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> laugh at themselves</strong>. Chivalry and art are the targets, and this can be directly applied to the tale within the frame.</p>
<p>As potent and eye-opening as it can be at times, Juvenalian satire lacks a degree of subtlety. It can often be hard to distinguish from pure scrutiny, which is less than desirable when the author is trying to use it as a rhetorical tool. Sometimes a gentler approach is more effective. At least, that is the philosophy behind the more playful counterpart, Horatian satire. This style is also named for an early Roman poet, Horace. Horatian satire is about indulgence, tolerance, amusement, and wit. The aim is to make the reader laugh not only at the subject of the criticism but also at themselves when they bear a resemblance to it. This is what we see in the tale of Don Quixote; at every turn, there is another absurd satiric parable about the dangers of romantic idealization. For instance, when Quixote sets the galley slaves free, he believes them to be unjustly punished. As repayment for his service, he asks only that they make a pilgrimage to his imaginary Princess and tell her the story. They instead beat him up and run off into the countryside with his things. We expect some form of gratitude, but their ironic reaction gives us a taste of how impractical his behavior truly, which is related to the fruits of romantic gallantry.</p>
<p><strong>Menippean Satire</strong> uses a variety of styles and tones to create a <strong>critical discourse about a high concept</strong>; Bakhtin, a widely renowned Russian philosopher and critique, lists the following characteristics:</p>
<p>It is usually more comic than Socratic dialogue.</p>
<p>Its fantasies create extraordinary situations for the purpose of testing philosophical truth, primarily through the manipulation of perspective.</p>
<p>It mixes the fantastic, symbolic, and even quasi-religious with a "crude slum naturalism."</p>
<p>It is "a genre of 'ultimate questions,'" combining bold invention with broad philosophical reflection.</p>
<p>It uses "experimental fantasticality," that is, "observation from some unusual point of view."</p>
<p>It often represents unusual states of insanity, split personality, dreams, excessive passion, creating a "dialogic relationship to one's self."</p>
<p>Scandal, eccentricities, inappropriate speech, violations of politeness, and social expectations are very characteristic.</p>
<p>It is full of contradictory behavior and characters.</p>
<p>It combines elements of social utopia with other satiric elements.</p>
<p>It inserts a variety of other genres, often to parody them.</p>
<p>Hence it is "multi-styled" and "multi-toned."</p>
<p>It is concerned with current topics. </p>
<p>Cervantes managed to employ both the biting criticism of Juvenalian satire and the gentle ridicule of Horatian satire. Nevertheless, the difference between the two is, in this case, only stylistic: they both have the same effect of criticizing the romantic traditions of Spain and the greater scale of Romance itself. However, underneath the actual text, we find a highly sympathetic subtext: though a fool and a nuisance, the character of Don Quixote is ultimately a force of good. His romantic mania inspires bravery, hope, joy, and initiative. Cervantes may portray him as exuberant and brash in the first part, but in the second, he becomes moderate, thoughtful, and helpful; the villains turn out to be those who scorn and abuse the dreamer, robbing him and the rest of the world of his great impossible dream. </p>
<p>Interestingly, this also implicates Cervantes and his metafictional cast. By ridiculing Don Quixote for dreaming unrealistically, Cervantes is also criticizing those who are inspired by Don Quixote. </p>
<p>Thus, rather than a simple satire meant to ridicule one subject, the entire piece becomes a dialogue, urging the audience to think critically about the subject in multiple ways. Don Quixote is therefore primarily a Menippean satire; that is, it is similar in style to the work of the third-century Greek poet Menippus. This style of satire utilizes a variety of tools and styles, prose verse, and variations in tone to create a critical discourse about a high concept rather than a specific person or institution. This is the simplest way to explain the genius of Don Quixote: Cervantes gives us satire of both Romance and its critics, but the story itself is about the value of Romanticism in a changing world.</p>
<p>While Cervantes is employing all three types of satire, it is Menippean satire that speaks to the deeper meaning behind his satirical approach. Here are some ways we can explore this concept:</p>
<p>Our hero, Don Quixote, dons the mask of a chivalric knight to make his life more exciting and bearable.</p>
<p>We can see the influence of Greek comedy on this novel: a crazy idea is proposed, and the rest of the work concerns how it plays out in the real world.</p>
<p>The humor lies in contrast between Don Quixote’s ideals and the real world around him.</p>
<p>French Jesuit Francois de la Noue warned against the dangerous influence of chivalric books on the young and claimed they were as harmful to the young as Machiavelli was to the old. </p>
<p>Plato made very similar claims.</p>
<p>Don Quixote is not a knight but an impoverished country landowner.</p>
<p>His ideals include love as ‘service,’ adventurousness, loyalty to valor, and generosity. He tries to seek out wrongs and correct them, to help those in need, and to be full of valor in honor of his Lady (courtly love).</p>
<p>Like Greek heroes, he wants his marvelous deeds to be sung.</p>
<p>Don Quixote is described as a wandering hero whose insanity is caused by reading too many books about chivalry (literature corrupts).</p>
<p>While class and racial prejudice are at the heart of Cervantes’ satire, in context, these critiques cannot be directly spoken as “truth to power,” at least not for Cervantes. For a frame of reference, one of his targets was the Spanish Inquisition, who tended to burn its detractors at the stake. He also takes aim at the slave trade, which was not a position to take for the faint of heart and was very dangerous. </p>
<p>To put this in perspective, Quijano, the name Cervantes chose for the protagonist, is notably and distinctly middle class; this is our inroad for understanding Cervantes’ complex critique of the politics and economics of the time: </p>
<p>First, consider Quijano himself: his Grandfather was once a hidalgo, but the days of that prosperity are reflected in the condition of the armor that Quixote ultimately dons: this ideal Spanish knight is now nothing but rot.</p>
<p>Then there is Rocinante, whose name translates to “the best of all workhorses,” which reflects the economic situation that the knight is forced to ride upon, not a true steed. Now, this may seem tangential, but consider the line when Cervantes refers to Rocinante’s hoof, that it possessed “with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela.” This is a nearly untranslatable pun on the word "quarto," which means a sand-crack in a horse's hoof, as well as the coin equal to one-eighth of the real. This is a direct reference to the terrible inflation that had occurred in Spain. </p>
<p>The scene with Quixote’s friends: the priest, a family friend, secures the keys to the library from Quixote’s niece and attempts to sort the offending books from the innocent ones. The niece implores him to pile them all in the corral and set them on fire, but the Priest insists on examining the titles to avoid the risk of destroying good books with the bad. Nevertheless, he soon tires of the effort and orders the housekeeper to take all the “large books” to the corral. This is a direct reference to the Spanish inquisition. There is no real way for the inquisition to know who is a heretic in their minds, and Cervantes mirrors how the process for identifying who or what was “good” quickly devolved as they ultimately burned whatever book they could. </p>
<p>This text is also rooted in real-world politics and history. Quixote himself references another text we will read this semester, <em>The Song of Roland</em>. This is important for two reasons: first, when we read Song of Roland, you may be confused that all the Spanish are depicted as heretics. For instance, Bernardo del Carpio, whom Quixote celebrates as an iconic knight, is the same knight that killed Roland! This is also relevant to the fact that the actual author of Quixote’s story wrote this in Arabic, and it was translated by a Moor. These Arabs are the very “heretics” that the government is attempting to expel via the Inquisition, even though they had been a part of the Spanish culture for hundreds of years, peacefully.</p>
