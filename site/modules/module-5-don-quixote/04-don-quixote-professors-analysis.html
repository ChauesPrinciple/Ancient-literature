<p>Don Quixote</p>
<p>“It is not doubted, but certainty, which drives us insane.”</p>
<p>Nietzsche – Ecco Homo</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must address that this text, often credited with being the first novel of the Western world, is also the first meta-fiction. Meta-fiction is not easy to define; however, although characteristics of metafiction vary as widely as the spectrum of techniques used, a pattern of several common traits can be traced.  These techniques often appear in combination but can also appear singularly.  Metafiction often employs intertextual references and allusions by:</p>
<p>examining fictional systems,</p>
<p>incorporating aspects of both theory and criticism,</p>
<p>creating biographies of imaginary writers,</p>
<p>presenting and discussing fictional works of an imaginary character.</p>
<p>Authors of metafiction often violate narrative levels by:</p>
<p>intruding to comment on writing,</p>
<p>involving his or herself with fictional characters,</p>
<p>directly addressing the reader,</p>
<p>Openly questioning how narrative assumptions and conventions transform and filter reality, trying to prove that no singular truths or meanings exist ultimately.</p>
<p>Metafiction also uses unconventional and experimental techniques:</p>
<p>rejecting conventional plots,</p>
<p>refusing to attempt to become "real life,"</p>
<p>subverting conventions to transform “reality” into a highly suspect concept,</p>
<p>flaunting and exaggerating the foundations of and the instability of their ideas,</p>
<p>displaying reflexivity (a function which enables the reader to understand the processes by which he or she reads the world as a text).</p>
<p>Another overarching theme of Don Quixote is the blending of reality and fiction, both in the real world in which we live and the fictional world in which Don Quixote lives. In the case of Don Quixote, it is impossible to discuss the real-world events behind the book without delving into some of the themes of the book itself because Cervantes himself blends reality so effectively. By the end of the book, even the reader does not know what truth or fiction is. Don Quixote, the character himself, is perceived as being a madman, although he is also described as being very sane. For example, there is a clear contrast between Don Quixote’s perception of roadside Inns as castles, of himself as a Noble Knight errant, and the fact that he is often remarked as being philosophical and wise when remarking on any subject except for knight-errantry. This duality of Don Quixote provides the basis for the blending or blurring of reality itself.</p>
<p>One of the first and most notable uses of this blurring technique comes from the author of the book, and by the author, I do not mean Miguel de Cervantes, although he was the man who wrote the text. He claims in the prologue to the first part of Don Quixote that he is not, in fact, the “father” of Don Quixote; he is the stepfather, merely stumbling across the manuscript and translating it. Thus, he acts not as the actual creator but simply as the messenger. Now, this narrator becomes a character within the book itself and will be separated from the action described within the text; however, he often remarks upon it, noting several passages as being apocryphal, commenting upon the narrative itself, why he translates certain things the way he did, or why he puts certain parts of the book in certain places.</p>
<p>Now, this narrator character even goes so far as to further distance himself from the actual author of the story by saying that he only found the first eight chapters of the manuscript. At the beginning of chapter nine, he says that he ran out of manuscripts and ultimately tells a long-winded tale of how he came across the rest of it. He stumbled upon the notebooks and loose leaves of paper comprising the manuscript accidentally and bought them from a local. The manuscript was written in Arabic, but the narrator's character does not speak it. The narrator, “Cervantes,” describes going to the local cathedral and finding an Arabic moor to be able to translate the rest of the text. Thus, he is not even the translator anymore; he is just the Messenger. He continues to act as a character in the book.</p>
<p>If that was not enough to blur the lines of the reality of who on earth is writing this text, Cervantes offers himself up as an actual named person within the book! At the end of the first part of Don Quixote, there is a character known as the captive, and his story, or “The Captives Tale,” tells of his being captured on the Mediterranean by Barbary Pirates and taken to Algiers, serving as a slave. The captive makes the escape of his own accord, though, something Cervantes was never able to achieve. Cervantes was ransomed, however, and all these experiences harken back to Cervantes’ own. He weaves his own story into the text, even going so far in the tale of the character to name himself as one of the officers involved in the original scuffle. His full name was Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, and the captive makes mention of having served with an officer Saavedra, so Miguel de Cervantes ultimately injects even his person and his namesake into the book.</p>
<p>It gets even stranger. The first part of the book, which Miguel de Cervantes published in 1605, ultimately becomes the MacGuffin device that moves the narrative within the second part of the book. Early in the second part of the book, Sancho Panza comes to Don Quixote and says that he ran into a man in town who says he has heard of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The reason that he is familiar with their adventures is that he has read them in a book. Within the book, Don Quixote says to Sancho that he must summon this man to him. Samson Carrasco enters the story and becomes a prominent character within the second part of the book. Carrasco says that he read the first part of the Adventures of Don Quixote. All the characters that Don Quixote meets in the second part of the book are familiar with him already because they, too, have read the adventures of the first part of Don Quixote. The book that we are reading is the device in the book that we are reading! It is upside down.</p>
<p>Cervantes’ initial (overt) purpose is to satirize the romances of chivalry, to create a parody of a literary type characterized by supernatural deeds of valor, implausible and complicated adventures, duels, and enchantments. The literature that expresses the medieval spirit of chivalry and romance has degenerated by Cervantes’ time.</p>
<p>His method of showing the inherent silliness of chivalric romances is</p>
<p>“to show what extraordinary consequences they would lead a man insanely infatuated with them, once this man set out to live ‘now’ according to their patterns of action and belief.”</p>
<p>In addition to chivalric romances, Cervantes parodies the pastoral novel in the section about Marcela, the shepherdess who is unmoved by her shepherd admirers.</p>
<p>Don Quixote is known for being a satire, which means it employs irony, exaggeration, ridicule, or humor to provide a criticism of something. It is not just one satire; however, it is two competing satires in the same story. We have the main story: Don Quixote, his exploits, and how they affect the people around him, and then there is another encompassing super story on top of it. Miguel de Cervantes tries to enforce the idea that the story is actual history by narrating it in the voice of a fictional Moorish translator. These characters, and apparently Cervantes himself, harbored overwhelmingly negative opinions of the romantic literary traditions of Spain, specifically the books of chivalry we mentioned earlier. In the words of Cervantes’ friend, the author's purpose in writing this story is the fall and destruction of that monstrous heap of ill-contrived romances, which, though abhorred by many, has so strangely infatuated the more significant part of humanity.</p>
<p>To say that Don Quixote is a satire and leave it at that would be a terrible disservice. Here is why: Satire is not a genre so much as it is a style. It is also important to note that in contemporary terms, the word satire is often best known as a type of comedy, but it does not have to be.  George Orwell’s 1984, for instance, is a far cry from funny, but it provides criticism.</p>
<p>Looking at the hyper-vitriolic language Cervantes uses to describe romantic literature, it is easy to assume that Don Quixote is a satire of the books of Chivalry. However, if we read closely, we will notice a contradiction: there is a disparity between the authorial input and the story's subtext. Don Quixote is Cervantes’ representation of Spain’s romantic traditions. Quixote often appears inept, ineffectual, and even minorly harmful in some cases, but the result of his adventures is positive. He brings lovers together, provides simple entertainment to a great many people, and helps his closest and most involved friend – his squire Sancho Panza – to discover himself and embrace his place in the world. Quixote becomes a genuinely sympathetic character by the novel's end, and the cruelty of his audience, represented by the Duke and Duchess, becomes the subject of criticism.</p>
<p>Juvenalian Satire is a satire that attacks its subjects with personal invective and general cynicism. It seeks change through outrage, attacks superfluous academic jargon, and can be seen in the (outer) frame of our story, where Cervantes has provided fake reviews for his own work.</p>
<p>Juvenalian satire style was named for an early Roman poet Juvenal, whose work criticized figures and institutions of the time through personal invective, angry moral indignation, and general cynicism. Juvenalian satire attacks its subject to incite change through outrage. This style of satire is crucial in understanding Don Quixote because, through metafiction, the Juvenalian satire comprises the bulk of the story's first layer of satire. Throughout both the first and second parts of the novel, Cervantes interjects, in the guise of fictional narrators, a relatively stark perspective on the state of Spanish literature at the time. Cervantes draws particular attention to the romanticizing of Chivalric texts at the time by juxtaposing Cervantes’ hyper vitriolic tone toward Chivalric texts with the emphatic praises of his metafictional translator (which is also him); this stark, biting criticism creates the first half of the book's fascinating satirical dynamic.</p>
<p>Horatian Satire is a satire that uses indulgence, tolerance, amusement, and wit to make the readers laugh at themselves. Chivalry and art are the targets, and this can be directly applied to the tale within the frame.</p>
<p>As potent and eye-opening as it can be at times, Juvenalian satire lacks a degree of subtlety. It can often be hard to distinguish from pure scrutiny, which is less than desirable when the author is trying to use it as a rhetorical tool. Sometimes, a gentler approach is more effective. At least, that is the philosophy behind the more playful counterpart, Horatian satire. This style is also named for an early Roman poet, Horace. Horatian satire is about indulgence, tolerance, amusement, and wit. The aim is to make the reader laugh not only at the subject of the criticism but also at themselves when they bear a resemblance to it. This is what we see in the tale of Don Quixote; at every turn, there is another absurd satiric parable about the dangers of romantic idealization. For instance, when Quixote sets the galley slaves free, he believes them to be unjustly punished. As repayment for his service, he asks only that they make a pilgrimage to his imaginary Princess and tell her the story. They instead beat him up and ran off into the countryside with his things. We expect some form of gratitude, but their ironic reaction gives us a taste of how impractical his behavior truly is, which is related to the fruits of romantic gallantry.</p>
<p>Menippean Satire uses a variety of styles and tones to create a critical discourse about a high concept; Bakhtin, a widely renowned Russian philosopher and critique, lists the following characteristics:</p>
<p>It is usually more comic than Socratic dialogue.</p>
<p>Its fantasies create extraordinary situations for the purpose of testing philosophical truth, primarily through the manipulation of perspective.</p>
<p>It mixes the fantastic, symbolic, and even quasi-religious with a "crude slum naturalism."</p>
<p>It is "a genre of 'ultimate questions,'" combining bold invention with broad philosophical reflection.</p>
<p>It uses "experimental fantasticality," that is, "observation from some unusual point of view."</p>
<p>It often represents unusual states of insanity, split personality, dreams, and excessive passion, creating a "dialogic relationship to one's self."</p>
<p>Scandals, eccentricities, inappropriate speech, violations of politeness, and social expectations are very characteristic.</p>
<p>It is full of contradictory behavior and characters.</p>
<p>It combines elements of social utopia with other satiric elements.</p>
<p>It inserts a variety of other genres, often to parody them.</p>
<p>Hence it is "multi-styled" and "multi-toned."</p>
<p>It is concerned with current topics.</p>
<p>Cervantes managed to employ both the biting criticism of Juvenalian satire and the gentle ridicule of Horatian satire. Nevertheless, the difference between the two is, in this case, only stylistic: they both have the same effect of criticizing the romantic traditions of Spain and the greater scale of Romance itself. However, underneath the actual text, we find a highly sympathetic subtext: though a fool and a nuisance, the character of Don Quixote is ultimately a force of good. His romantic mania inspires bravery, hope, joy, and initiative. Cervantes may portray him as exuberant and brash in the first part, but in the second, he becomes moderate, thoughtful, and helpful; the villains turn out to be those who scorn and abuse the dreamer, robbing him and the rest of the world of his great impossible dream.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this also implicates Cervantes and his metafictional cast. By ridiculing Don Quixote for dreaming unrealistically, Cervantes is also criticizing those who are inspired by Don Quixote.</p>
<p>Thus, rather than a simple satire meant to ridicule one subject, the entire piece becomes a dialogue, urging the audience to think critically about the subject in multiple ways. Don Quixote is therefore, primarily a Menippean satire; that is, it is similar in style to the work of the third-century Greek poet Menippus. This style of satire utilizes a variety of tools and styles, prose verse, and variations in tone to create a critical discourse about a high concept rather than a specific person or institution. This is the simplest way to explain the genius of Don Quixote: Cervantes gives us satire of both Romance and its critics, but the story itself is about the value of Romanticism in a changing world.</p>
<p>While Cervantes employs all three types of satire, it is Menippean satire that speaks to the deeper meaning behind his satirical approach. Here are some ways we can explore this concept:</p>
<p>Our hero, Don Quixote, dons the mask of a chivalric knight to make his life more exciting and bearable.</p>
<p>We can see the influence of Greek comedy on this novel: a crazy idea is proposed, and the rest of the work concerns how it plays out in the real world.</p>
<p>The humor lies in the contrast between Don Quixote’s ideals and the real world around him.</p>
<p>French Jesuit Francois de la Noue warned against the dangerous influence of chivalric books on the young and claimed they were as harmful to the young as Machiavelli was to the old.</p>
<p>Plato made very similar claims.</p>
<p>Don Quixote is not a knight but an impoverished country landowner.</p>
<p>His ideals include love as ‘service,’ adventurousness, loyalty to valor, and generosity. He tries to seek out wrongs and correct them, to help those in need, and to be full of valor in honor of his Lady (courtly love).</p>
<p>Like Greek heroes, he wants his marvelous deeds to be sung.</p>
<p>Don Quixote is described as a wandering hero whose insanity is caused by reading too many books about chivalry (literature corrupts).</p>
<p>While class and racial prejudice are at the heart of Cervantes’ satire, in context, these critiques cannot be directly spoken of as “truth to power,” at least not for Cervantes. For a frame of reference, one of his targets was the Spanish Inquisition, which tended to burn its detractors at stake. He also takes aim at the slave trade, which was not a position to take for the faint of heart and was very dangerous.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, Quijano, the name Cervantes chose for the protagonist, is notably and distinctly middle class; this is our inroad for understanding Cervantes’ complex critique of the politics and economics of the time:</p>
<p>First, consider Quijano himself: his Grandfather was once a hidalgo, but the days of that prosperity are reflected in the condition of the armor that Quixote ultimately dons: this ideal Spanish knight is now nothing but rot.</p>
<p>Then there is Rocinante, whose name translates to “the best of all workhorses,” which reflects the economic situation that the knight is forced to ride upon, not a true steed. Now, this may seem tangential, but consider the line when Cervantes refers to Rocinante’s hoof, that it possessed “with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela.” This is a nearly untranslatable pun on the word "quarto," which means a sand-crack in a horse's hoof, as well as the coin equal to one-eighth of the real. This is a direct reference to the terrible inflation that had occurred in Spain.</p>
<p>The scene with Quixote’s friends: the priest, a family friend, secures the keys to the library from Quixote’s niece and attempts to sort the offending books from the innocent ones. The niece implores him to pile them all in the corral and set them on fire, but the Priest insists on examining the titles to avoid the risk of destroying good books with the bad. Nevertheless, he soon tires of the effort and orders the housekeeper to take all the “large books” to the corral. This is a direct reference to the Spanish Inquisition. There is no real way for the Inquisition to know who is a heretic in their minds, and Cervantes mirrors how the process for identifying who or what was “good” quickly devolved as they ultimately burned whatever book they could.</p>
<p>This text is also rooted in real-world politics and history. Quixote himself references another text we will read this semester, The Song of Roland. This is important for two reasons: first when we read Song of Roland, we may be confused that all the Spanish are depicted as heretics. For instance, Bernardo del Carpio, whom Quixote celebrates as an iconic knight, is the same knight that killed Roland! This is also relevant to the fact that the actual author of Quixote’s story wrote this in Arabic, and it was translated by a Moor. These Arabs are the very “heretics” that the government is attempting to expel via the Inquisition, even though they had been a part of the Spanish culture for hundreds of years, peacefully.</p>
