<h4><span id="anchor_Toc163145570">The Wife of Bath’s Prologue</span></h4>
<p><em><strong>The Prologue to the Wife of Bath’s Tale</strong></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Experience, though no authority</p>
<p>Ruled in this world, would be enough for me</p>
<p>To speak of the woe that is in marriage.</p>
<p>For, lordings, since I twelve years was of age,</p>
<p>Thanks be to God who eternally does thrive,</p>
<p>Husbands at church-door have I had five –</p>
<p>If it be allowed so oft to wedded be –</p>
<p>And all were worthy men in their degree.</p>
<p>But I was told, for sure, and not long since,</p>
<p>That since Christ never went but once</p>
<p>To a wedding, in Cana of Galilee,</p>
<p>That by the same example He taught me</p>
<p>That I should only be wedded once.</p>
<p>Hark too, lo, what sharp words for the nonce</p>
<p>Beside a well, Jesus, God and Man,</p>
<p>Spoke in reproof of the Samaritan:</p>
<p>‘You have had five husbands,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>‘And that same man that now has thee</p>
<p>Is not your husband’ – so he said for certain.</p>
<p>What he meant by that, I can’t explain;</p>
<p>But I ask you why the fifth man</p>
<p>Was not husband of the Samaritan?</p>
<p>How many was she allowed in marriage?</p>
<p>I have never yet had despite my age</p>
<p>Of that number any definition.</p>
<p>Men may divine and gloss, up and down,</p>
<p>But well I know, indeed, without a lie,</p>
<p>God bade us all to wax and multiply.</p>
<p>That gentle text I well can understand!</p>
<p>And I know too He said that my husband</p>
<p>Should leave father and mother and cleave to me;</p>
<p>But of no number mention made He,</p>
<p>Of bigamy or of octogamy.</p>
<p>Why should men then speak of it evilly?</p>
<p>Lo, here, the wise King, old Solomon,</p>
<p>I think he had more wives than one!</p>
<p>As would to God it were permitted me</p>
<p>To be refreshed half so oft as he!</p>
<p>A gift of God had he of all those wives!</p>
<p>No man has such that’s in this world alive.</p>
<p>God knows, that noble king, as I see it,</p>
<p>The first night had many a merry fit</p>
<p>With each of them, so happy was his life!</p>
<p>Blessed be God, that I have wedded five,</p>
<p>And they I picked out from all the best,</p>
<p>Both for their nether purse and their chest.</p>
<p>Diverse schools make perfect clerks,</p>
<p>And diverse practice in many sundry works,</p>
<p>Makes the workman perfect, certainly.</p>
<p>Of five husbands have I made a study;</p>
<p>Welcome the sixth, whenever he befall!</p>
<p>Forsooth, I will not keep me chaste in all;</p>
<p>When my husband from this world is gone,</p>
<p>Some Christian man shall wed me anon.</p>
<p>For then the Apostle says that I am free</p>
<p>To wed, in God’s name, where it pleases me.</p>
<p>He says to be wedded is no sin, I learn:</p>
<p>‘Better to be wedded than to burn.’</p>
<p>What care I if folk speak maliciously</p>
<p>Of wicked Lamech and his bigamy?</p>
<p>I know that Abraham was a holy man,</p>
<p>And Jacob also, as far as ever I can,</p>
<p>And each of them had more wives than two,</p>
<p>And many another holy man had too.</p>
<p>Where can you show me, in any age</p>
<p>That God on high forbade our marriage</p>
<p>By express word? I pray you, tell it me.</p>
<p>Or where commanded he virginity?</p>
<p>I know as well as you, what he said,</p>
<p>The Apostle, when he spoke of maidenhead,</p>
<p>He said that precepts for it he had none.</p>
<p>Men may counsel a woman to live alone,</p>
<p>But counselling is no commandment;</p>
<p>He has left it to our own judgement.</p>
<p>For had God commanded maidenhood,</p>
<p>Then had he ended marriage and for good.</p>
<p>And surely, if there were never seed sown,</p>
<p>Virginity, where would that be grown?</p>
<p>Paul did not dare command, not in the least,</p>
<p>A thing of which his Master never preached.</p>
<p>The spear, the prize, is there of virginity;</p>
<p>Catch it who may, and who runs best let’s see!</p>
<p>But this word is not said of every wight,</p>
<p>Rather God’s pleased to grant it of his might.</p>
<p>I know well that the Apostle was a maid,</p>
<p>But nonetheless, though he wrote and said</p>
<p>He wished that everyone was such as He,</p>
<p>He was but counselling virginity,</p>
<p>And to be wife he still gave me leave</p>
<p>Of indulgence; so no reproof indeed,</p>
<p>If my husband die, in wedding me,</p>
<p>No objection on grounds of bigamy,</p>
<p>Though it were good no woman for to touch –</p>
<p>He meant in bed or on a couch or such –</p>
<p>For peril it is, fire and tow to assemble –</p>
<p>You know what this image does resemble!</p>
<p>The long and short: he held virginity</p>
<p>More perfect than marriage in frailty.</p>
<p>Frailty I say, unless the he and she</p>
<p>Would live all their life in chastity.</p>
<p>I grant it well, I would have no envy,</p>
<p>Though maidenhood devalue bigamy.</p>
<p>They like to be clean in body and ghost.</p>
<p>And of my state I will make no boast;</p>
<p>For you well know, a lord in his household</p>
<p>Has not ever vessel made all of gold.</p>
<p>Some are of wood, and do good service.</p>
<p>God calls folk in sundry ways like this,</p>
<p>And everyone has from God his own gift,</p>
<p>Some this, some that, as is in His wish.</p>
<p>Virginity is a great perfection</p>
<p>And continence also with devotion.</p>
<p>But Christ, of perfection is the well,</p>
<p>And bade not everyone to go and sell</p>
<p>All that he had, and give it to the poor,</p>
<p>And in that guise follow him, for sure.</p>
<p>He spoke to those who would live perfectly;</p>
<p>And, lordings, by your leave, that is not me!</p>
<p>I will bestow the flower of my age</p>
<p>On the actions and the fruits of marriage.</p>
<p>Tell me then, to what end and conclusion</p>
<p>Were made the members of generation,</p>
<p>And in so perfect wise Man was wrought?</p>
<p>Trust me right well, they were not made for naught.</p>
<p>Gloss as you will and give the explanation</p>
<p>That they were made merely for purgation</p>
<p>Of urine, and both our things, so the tale,</p>
<p>Made but to know the female from the male,</p>
<p>And for no other purpose – say you no?</p>
<p>Experience knows well it is not so.</p>
<p>So long as the clerics with me be not wrath,</p>
<p>I say this: that they are made for both –</p>
<p>That is to say, for office and for ease</p>
<p>Of procreation, that we not God displease.</p>
<p>Why else is it in the books clearly set</p>
<p>That a man shall pay his wife her debt?</p>
<p>Now wherewith should he make his payment,</p>
<p>If he did not use his blessed instrument?</p>
<p>Thus were they added to the creature</p>
<p>To purge urine, and continue nature.</p>
<p>But I do not say every wight is told</p>
<p>That has such tackle, as I unfold,</p>
<p>To go and use it to engender there –</p>
<p>Or men for chastity would have no care.</p>
<p>Christ was a maid, yet formed as a man,</p>
<p>And many a saint since the world began,</p>
<p>Yet lived they ever in perfect chastity.</p>
<p>I have no quarrel with virginity;</p>
<p>Of pure wheat-seed let them be bred,</p>
<p>And let us wives be dubbed barley-bread –</p>
<p>And yet with barley-bread, as Mark can</p>
<p>Remind you, Jesus fed full many a man.</p>
<p>In such a state as God has called us,</p>
<p>I will persevere; I am not precious.</p>
<p>In wifehood will I use my instrument</p>
<p>As freely as my Maker has it sent.</p>
<p>If I be niggardly, God give me sorrow!</p>
<p>My husband shall have it eve and morrow,</p>
<p>When he would come forth and pay his debt.</p>
<p>A husband I will have, I will as yet,</p>
<p>Who shall be both my debtor and my thrall,</p>
<p>And bear the tribulation withal</p>
<p>On his own flesh, while I am his wife.</p>
<p>I have the power during my whole life</p>
<p>Over his proper body, and not he.</p>
<p>Right thus the Apostle told it me,</p>
<p>And bade our husbands for to love us well;</p>
<p>On that saying I ever like to dwell.’</p>
<p>Up started the Pardoner, and that anon:</p>
<p>‘Now dame,’ quoth he, ‘by God and by Saint John,</p>
<p>You are a noble preacher in this cause!</p>
<p>I was about to wed a wife: I pause!</p>
<p>What! Should I pay, with my own flesh, so dear?</p>
<p>I’d rather wed no wife, then, any year!’</p>
<p>‘Abide,’ quoth she, ‘my tale’s not yet begun.</p>
<p>Nay, you will drink from a different tun,</p>
<p>Before I go, and savour worse than ale.</p>
<p>And when I have told you all my tale</p>
<p>Of tribulation in marriage,</p>
<p>In which I am an expert at my age –</p>
<p>That is to say, I have been the whip –</p>
<p>Then please yourself whether you wish to sip</p>
<p>Of this tun that I shall broach.</p>
<p>Beware of it, before a close approach!</p>
<p>For I shall give examples more than ten.</p>
<p>‘Whoever will not be warned by other men,</p>
<p>To other men shall an example be.’</p>
<p>These very words writes Ptolemy;</p>
<p>Read in his <em>Almagest</em>, and find them there.’</p>
<p>‘Dame, I would pray you, if it is your care,’</p>
<p>Said this Pardoner, ‘as you began,</p>
<p>Tell forth your tale; spare not any man,</p>
<p>And teach us young men of your practices.’</p>
<p>‘Gladly,’ quoth she, ‘if you it pleases.</p>
<p>But yet I ask of all this company,</p>
<p>If I should chance to speak out of whimsy,</p>
<p>Take no offence then at what I say,</p>
<p>For my intention is but to play.</p>
<p>Now sir, then will I tell you all my tale.</p>
<p>If ever I might drink of wine or ale,</p>
<p>I shall speak true: those husbands that I had</p>
<p>Three of them were good, and two were bad.</p>
<p>The three good men were rich and old.</p>
<p>With difficulty only could they hold</p>
<p>To the articles that bound them to me –</p>
<p>You know well what I mean by that, I see!</p>
<p>So help me God, I laugh when I think</p>
<p>That sad to say they never slept a wink.</p>
<p>And, by my faith, I set by it no store.</p>
<p>They gave me land and treasure more;</p>
<p>I had no need to show them diligence</p>
<p>To win their love, or do them reverence.</p>
<p>They loved me so well, by God above</p>
<p>I had no need to set store by their love.</p>
<p>A wise woman will busy herself anon</p>
<p>To win her love, yes, if she has none.</p>
<p>But since I held them wholly in my hand,</p>
<p>And since they had given me all their land,</p>
<p>Why should I be concerned to please,</p>
<p>Except for my own profit and my ease?</p>
<p>I set them so to work, by my faith,</p>
<p>That many a night they sang “well-away!”</p>
<p>But never for us the flitch of bacon though,</p>
<p>That some may win in Essex at Dunmow.</p>
<p>I ruled them so according to my law,</p>
<p>That each of them was blissful and in awe,</p>
<p>And brought me pretty things from the fair.</p>
<p>They were full glad when I spoke them fair,</p>
<p>For God knows, I chid them mercilessly.</p>
<p>Now hearken how to act properly.</p>
<p>You wise wives that will understand,</p>
<p>Put them ever in the wrong, out of hand,</p>
<p>For half so boldly there never was a man</p>
<p>Could swear oaths and lie as woman can.</p>
<p>I say this not for wives who are wise,</p>
<p>Unless it be when they are mis-advised.</p>
<p>A wise wife, if she knows good from bad,</p>
<p>Will call the chattering magpies merely mad,</p>
<p>And obtain the witness of her own maid</p>
<p>To what she asserts – listen how I played:</p>
<p>“Old sir dotard is this then your way?</p>
<p>Why is my neighbour’s wife dressed so gay?</p>
<p>She is honoured now wherever she goes;</p>
<p>I sit at home; and lacking decent clothes.</p>
<p>What are you doing at my neighbour’s house?</p>
<p>Is she so fair? Are you so amorous?</p>
<p>What do you whisper to the maid, <em>benedicitee</em>?</p>
<p>Old sir lecher, away with your trickery!</p>
<p>And if I have a gossip with a friend,</p>
<p>All innocently, you chide like the fiend</p>
<p>If I walk or wander to his house.</p>
<p>Yet you come home drunk as a mouse,</p>
<p>And preach from your chair, beyond belief!</p>
<p>You tell me, then, how it’s a great mischief</p>
<p>To wed a poor woman, the expense,</p>
<p>And then if she’s rich, of good descent,</p>
<p>Then you say it’s a torment, and misery</p>
<p>To endure her pride and melancholy.</p>
<p>And if she be fair, you proper knave,</p>
<p>You say that every lecher has his way</p>
<p>With her, since none in chastity abide,</p>
<p>When they are assailed from every side.</p>
<p>You say, that some desire us for our riches,</p>
<p>Some for our shapeliness, some for our fairness,</p>
<p>And some because we can sing or dance,</p>
<p>And some for gentleness and dalliance,</p>
<p>Some for our hands and arms so small –</p>
<p>By your word, thus to the devil go us all!</p>
<p>You say men never hold a castle wall,</p>
<p>If it is long laid siege to, it will fall.</p>
<p>And if she be foul, you say that she</p>
<p>Covets every man that she might see,</p>
<p>For like a spaniel she will at him leap</p>
<p>Till she finds some man to take her cheap;</p>
<p>Never a goose so grey swam on the lake</p>
<p>That, say you, it will not find a mate.</p>
<p>You say it’s a hard thing to control</p>
<p>What no man willingly will hold.</p>
<p>Thus say you, lord, on your way to bed,</p>
<p>And that no wise man ever needs to wed,</p>
<p>Nor no man that has his eye on Heaven –</p>
<p>Wild thunderbolts and lightning-fire then</p>
<p>Fall on your withered neck till it be broke!</p>
<p>You say that leaking roofs, and thick smoke,</p>
<p>And chiding wives can make men flee</p>
<p>From their own house – ah, <em>benedicitee</em>,</p>
<p>What ails the old man so to make him chide?</p>
<p>You say we wives will all our vices hide</p>
<p>Till we be wed, and then we show them you.</p>
<p>That may well be the saying of a shrew!</p>
<p>You say that oxen, asses, horse and hound,</p>
<p>Can be tried over every sort of ground,</p>
<p>Basins, bowls, before a man may buy;</p>
<p>Spoons, stools, and all such things we try,</p>
<p>And likewise pots, clothes, and finery,</p>
<p>But wives must remain a mystery</p>
<p>Till they be wedded, you old dotard shrew!</p>
<p>And then, we will our vices show, says you.</p>
<p>You say too that it displeases me</p>
<p>Unless you forever praise my beauty,</p>
<p>And every moment pore o’er my face,</p>
<p>And call me “fair dame” in every place,</p>
<p>And lay out for a feast upon the day</p>
<p>When I was born, and make me fresh and gay,</p>
<p>And do my old nurse every honour,</p>
<p>And my chambermaid in my bower,</p>
<p>And my father’s kin and his allies;</p>
<p>So say you, old barrel-full of lies!</p>
<p>And yet because of our apprentice, Jankin,</p>
<p>And his crisp hair, that shines as gold so fine,</p>
<p>And his squiring me both up and down,</p>
<p>You harbour false suspicion, as I found;</p>
<p>I would not want him if you died tomorrow!</p>
<p>But tell me this, why do you hide, a sorrow,</p>
<p>The keys of your chest away from me?</p>
<p>They are my goods as well as yours, pardee!</p>
<p>What, will you make an idiot of your dame?</p>
<p>Now, by that lord who is called Saint James,</p>
<p>You shall not both, whatever be your moods,</p>
<p>Be master of my body, and my goods.</p>
<p>One you shall forgo, so say I,</p>
<p>What need have you to enquire or spy?</p>
<p>I think you’d like to lock me in your chest!</p>
<p>You should say: “Wife, go where you wish.</p>
<p>Take your pleasure; I’ll believe no malice.</p>
<p>I know you for a true wife, Dame Alice.”</p>
<p>We love no man that keeps watch, takes charge</p>
<p>Of where we go; we wish to be at large.</p>
<p>Of all men the most blessed must be,</p>
<p>That wise astrologer, old Ptolemy,</p>
<p>That writ this proverb in his <em>Almagest</em>:</p>
<p>“Of all men his wisdom is the highest</p>
<p>That cares not who has this world in his hand.”</p>
<p>By this proverb you must understand,</p>
<p>If you’ve enough, why should you care</p>
<p>How merrily other folks do fare?</p>
<p>Be sure, old dotard, by your leave</p>
<p>You shall have all you wish at eve.</p>
<p>He is too great a niggard who will spurn</p>
<p>A man who wants a light from his lantern;</p>
<p>He will have no less light, pardee!</p>
<p>If you’ve enough, don’t complain to me.</p>
<p>You say too, if we make ourselves gay</p>
<p>With clothing, and with precious array,</p>
<p>It puts us in peril of our chastity.</p>
<p>And yet – curse it – you make free</p>
<p>With these words in the Apostle’s name:</p>
<p>“In clothing made of chastity and shame</p>
<p>You women shall adorn yourselves,” quoth he,</p>
<p>“And not with braided hair, or jewellery,</p>
<p>With pearls, or with gold, or clothes rich.”</p>
<p>According to your text, as your tricks,</p>
<p>I’ll not act, not as much as a gnat!</p>
<p>You said then, that I was like a cat,</p>
<p>For whosoever singes a cat’s skin</p>
<p>Then will the cat keep to his inn;</p>
<p>While if the cat’s skin be sleek and gay,</p>
<p>She’ll not dwell in that house half a day.</p>
<p>But out she’ll pad, ere any daylight fall,</p>
<p>To show her skin, and go and caterwaul.</p>
<p>That is to say, if I feel gay, sir shrew,</p>
<p>I’ll run and show my old clothes to the view.</p>
<p>Sir, old fool, what use to you are spies?</p>
<p>Though you beg Argus with his hundred eyes</p>
<p>To be my body-guard, since he best is,</p>
<p>In faith, he shall not if it’s not my wish.</p>
<p>Yet I will trim his beard, as I may thee!</p>
<p>Then you said that there are things three,</p>
<p>The which things trouble all this earth,</p>
<p>And that no man may endure the fourth –</p>
<p>Away, sir shrew, Jesus trim your life!</p>
<p>You preach again and say a hateful wife</p>
<p>Is reckoned to be one of these mischances.</p>
<p>Are there then no other circumstances</p>
<p>You could address your parables to,</p>
<p>Without a poor wife acting one for you?</p>
<p>You even liken woman’s love to Hell,</p>
<p>To barren land, where water may not dwell.</p>
<p>You liken it then, as well, to a wild fire:</p>
<p>The more it burns, the more it has desire</p>
<p>To consume everything that burnt can be.</p>
<p>You say, that just as insects kill a tree,</p>
<p>Just so a wife destroys her husband;</p>
<p>This they know who to a wife are bound.”</p>
<p>Lordings, like this it was, you understand,</p>
<p>I kept my older husbands well in hand</p>
<p>With what they said in their drunkenness;</p>
<p>And all was false, but I had witnesses</p>
<p>In Jankin, and in my niece also.</p>
<p>O Lord, the pain I did them and the woe,</p>
<p>Full innocent, by God’s sweet destiny!</p>
<p>For like a horse I could bite and whinny.</p>
<p>I could moan, when I was the guilty one</p>
<p>Or else I’d oftentimes been done and gone.</p>
<p>Who at the mill is first, first grinds their grain;</p>
<p>So was our strife ended: I did first complain.</p>
<p>They were right glad and quick to apologise</p>
<p>For things they never did in all their lives.</p>
<p>For wenching I would take the man in hand,</p>
<p>Though him so sick he could hardly stand.</p>
<p>Yet it tickled his heart, in that he</p>
<p>Thought I was fond of him as he of me.</p>
<p>I swore that all my walking out at night</p>
<p>Was just to spy on the wenches that I cite;</p>
<p>Flying that flag caused me many a mirth.</p>
<p>For all such wit is given us at birth;</p>
<p>Deceit, weeping, spinning, God gives</p>
<p>To woman by nature, while she lives.</p>
<p>And of one thing I can boast, you see:</p>
<p>I had the better of them in high degree,</p>
<p>By cunning, force, or some manner of thing,</p>
<p>Such as continual murmuring and grumbling.</p>
<p>And in bed especially they had mischance:</p>
<p>There was my chiding and remonstrance.</p>
<p>I would no longer in the bed abide,</p>
<p>If I felt his arm across my side,</p>
<p>Till he had paid his ransom to me;</p>
<p>Then would I let him do his nicety.</p>
<p>And therefore every man this tale I tell,</p>
<p>Win whosoever may, for all’s to sell!</p>
<p>With empty hand you will no falcon lure.</p>
<p>In winning would I all his lust endure,</p>
<p>And display a feigned appetite –</p>
<p>And yet in bacon I took no delight.</p>
<p>That was the cause ever I would them chide;</p>
<p>For though the Pope had sat down beside,</p>
<p>I would not spare them at their own board,</p>
<p>For, by my troth, I paid them word for word.</p>
<p>As may aid me God the Omnipotent,</p>
<p>Though I this minute make my testament,</p>
<p>I owe them not a word that was not quits!</p>
<p>I brought it about so by my wits</p>
<p>That they were forced to yield, for the best,</p>
<p>Or else we would never have found rest.</p>
<p>For though he might rage like a maddened lion,</p>
<p>Yet he would always fail in his conclusion.</p>
<p>Then would I say: “My dear, note how meek</p>
<p>The look that Willikin displays, our sheep!</p>
<p>Come here, my spouse, let me kiss your cheek.</p>
<p>You should be as patient, and as meek,</p>
<p>And have as sweet and mild a conscience,</p>
<p>Since you preach so much of Job’s patience.</p>
<p>Practice endurance ever that you preach;</p>
<p>And if you don’t then certainly I’ll teach</p>
<p>How fair it is to have a wife at peace.</p>
<p>One of us two must yield, at least,</p>
<p>And since a man is more reasonable</p>
<p>Than a woman, you should be tractable.</p>
<p>What ails you, to grumble so and groan?</p>
<p>Is it you would possess my sex alone?</p>
<p>Why, take it all; lo, have it every bit!</p>
<p>Saint Peter damn you if you don’t enjoy it!</p>
<p>For if I were to sell my <em>belle chose</em>,</p>
<p>I could go as fresh as is the rose;</p>
<p>But I will keep it for your own use.</p>
<p>By God, you are to blame, and that’s the truth.”</p>
<p>Such manner of words have we on hand.</p>
<p>Now will I speak of my fourth husband.</p>
<p>My fourth husband was a reveller;</p>
<p>That is to say, he kept a lover.</p>
<p>And I was young, and my spirits high,</p>
<p>Stubborn and strong, and pert as a magpie.</p>
<p>How I danced to the harp, without fail,</p>
<p>And sang, indeed, like any nightingale,</p>
<p>When I had drunk a draught of sweet wine.</p>
<p>Metellius, the foul churl, the swine,</p>
<p>That with a stick robbed his wife of life</p>
<p>For drinking wine, though I had been his wife</p>
<p>Would never have frightened me from drink!</p>
<p>And after wine on Venus I would think,</p>
<p>For as surely as cold engenders hail,</p>
<p>A gluttonous mouth gets a lecherous tail.</p>
<p>A drunken woman has no true defence;</p>
<p>This lechers know from their experience.</p>
<p>But, Lord Christ, whenever in memory</p>
<p>I recall my youth and all my jollity,</p>
<p>It tickles me about my heart’s root.</p>
<p>To this day it does my heart good,</p>
<p>That I have had the world, in my time.</p>
<p>But age, alas, that poisons every clime,</p>
<p>Bereft me of beauty, vigour with it.</p>
<p>Let go, farewell; and the devil take it!</p>
<p>The flour is gone, what more is there to tell.</p>
<p>The bran, as best I can, now I must sell.</p>
<p>But yet to be right merry, I have planned!</p>
<p>Now will I tell you of my fourth husband.</p>
<p>I say, I felt at heart a deal of spite</p>
<p>If he in any other took delight;</p>
<p>But he was paid, by God and Saint Judoc!</p>
<p>I made him of the same wood a crook –</p>
<p>Not of my body, in some foul manner,</p>
<p>But was such friends with folk, by and by,</p>
<p>That in his own grease I made him fry,</p>
<p>For anger, and for very jealousy.</p>
<p>By God, on earth I was his purgatory!</p>
<p>For which I hope his soul is in glory.</p>
<p>For, God knows, he sat full oft in song,</p>
<p>When his shoe pinched him all along.</p>
<p>There is none but God and he who knew</p>
<p>In how many ways I tortured him anew.</p>
<p>He died when I returned from Jerusalem,</p>
<p>And lies there buried under the rood-beam,</p>
<p>Albeit his tomb’s not so curious</p>
<p>As was the sepulchre of Darius,</p>
<p>That Apelles sculpted subtly;</p>
<p>It were a waste to bury him preciously.</p>
<p>May he fare well, God give his soul rest!</p>
<p>He is now in his grave and in his chest.</p>
<p>Now of my fifth husband will I tell.</p>
<p>God may his soul never come to Hell!</p>
<p>And yet to me he was the worst, I know –</p>
<p>I feel it on my ribs all in a row,</p>
<p>And ever shall, until my dying day.</p>
<p>But in our bed he was so fresh, I say,</p>
<p>And could cajole me so, God knows,</p>
<p>When that he would have my <em>belle chose</em>,</p>
<p>That though he’d beaten me on every bone,</p>
<p>He could still win my love to him anon.</p>
<p>I swear I loved him best, because he</p>
<p>Was in his love niggardly to me.</p>
<p>We women have, you’ll hear no lie from me,</p>
<p>In this affair a strange fantasy:</p>
<p>Whatever we may not easily get,</p>
<p>We cry all day and crave for it.</p>
<p>Forbid us aught, desire it then will we;</p>
<p>Press on us hard, and we will flee.</p>
<p>Reluctantly we show our goods at fairs;</p>
<p>Great crowds at market make for dear wares,</p>
<p>And what is cheap is held a worthless prize.</p>
<p>This knows every woman who is wise.</p>
<p>My fifth husband – God his soul bless! –</p>
<p>Whom I took for love, not for riches,</p>
<p>He sometime was a clerk of Oxford town,</p>
<p>And left the college, and seeking found</p>
<p>Lodgings with my friend, there made one –</p>
<p>God keep her soul! Her name was Alison.</p>
<p>She knew my heart, and my secrets she,</p>
<p>Better than our parish priest, trust me.</p>
<p>To her I revealed my secrets all;</p>
<p>For had my husband pissed against a wall,</p>
<p>Or done some crime that would cost his life,</p>
<p>To her, and to another worthy wife,</p>
<p>And to my niece, that I loved as well,</p>
<p>I would have told the secret, just to tell.</p>
<p>And so I did full often, God knows</p>
<p>It made his face full often like a rose,</p>
<p>Red hot for very shame, and sorry he</p>
<p>For telling me his secret privately.</p>
<p>And so befell it that one day in Lent –</p>
<p>For often to my friend’s house I went,</p>
<p>As ever yet I loved to laugh and play,</p>
<p>And to walk in March, April, and May,</p>
<p>To hear sundry tales among the alleys –</p>
<p>Jankin clerk, and I, and my friend Alice,</p>
<p>Into the fields about the city went.</p>
<p>My husband was in London all that Lent;</p>
<p>I had the greater leisure for to play,</p>
<p>And to see, and be seen, every day</p>
<p>By lusty folk. How did I know what grace</p>
<p>Might be my destiny, and in what place?</p>
<p>Therefore I made my visitations</p>
<p>Went to vigils, and also to processions,</p>
<p>To preaching too, and these pilgrimages,</p>
<p>To the miracle plays, and marriages,</p>
<p>And wore my gay scarlet as I might.</p>
<p>The worms, and the moths, and mites</p>
<p>Upon my soul, gnawed it never a bit;</p>
<p>And why? Well, I was never out of it.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you now what happened to me:</p>
<p>I say that in the fields around walked we,</p>
<p>Till truly we made such a dalliance,</p>
<p>This clerk and I, that at a chance</p>
<p>I spoke to him, and said to him that he,</p>
<p>If I became a widow, should marry me.</p>
<p>For certainly, with no false modesty,</p>
<p>I was never without a little surety</p>
<p>Of marriage, nor ever had far to seek.</p>
<p>I hold a mouse’s heart not worth a leek,</p>
<p>That only has one little hole to bolt to,</p>
<p>And if that fail, then everything is through.</p>
<p>I maintained he had enchanted me;</p>
<p>My mother taught me that subtlety.</p>
<p>And I said too, I dreamed of him all night;</p>
<p>He seemed to slay me as I lay upright,</p>
<p>And all my bed indeed was full of blood –</p>
<p>“But yet I hope that you will do me good,</p>
<p>For blood betokens gold as I was taught.”</p>
<p>And all was false; I never dreamed of aught,</p>
<p>But by way of following mother’s lore,</p>
<p>In things like that as well as others more.</p>
<p>But now, sir – let me see – what’s to explain?</p>
<p>Aha! By God, I have my tale again!</p>
<p>When my fourth husband was on his bier,</p>
<p>I wept for hours, and sorry did appear –</p>
<p>As wives must, since it’s common usage,</p>
<p>And with my kerchief covered up my visage.</p>
<p>But since I was provided with a mate,</p>
<p>I only wept a little, I should state.</p>
<p>To church was my husband borne that morrow,</p>
<p>With neighbours that wept for him in sorrow,</p>
<p>And Jankin, our clerk, was one of those.</p>
<p>So help me God, when I saw him go</p>
<p>After the bier, I thought he had a pair</p>
<p>Of legs and of feet so fine and fair,</p>
<p>That all my heart I gave to him to hold.</p>
<p>He was, I swear, but twenty winters old,</p>
<p>And I was forty, to tell the truth,</p>
<p>But yet I always had a coltish tooth.</p>
<p>Gap-toothed I was, and that became me well;</p>
<p>I’d the print of Venus’ seal, truth to tell.</p>
<p>So help me God, I was a lusty one,</p>
<p>And fair, and rich, high-spirited and young!</p>
<p>And truly, as my husbands told me,</p>
<p>I had the finest <em>quoniam</em> that might be.</p>
<p>For certain, I am all Venereal</p>
<p>In feeling, and my heart is Martial.</p>
<p>Venus gave me my lust, lasciviousness,</p>
<p>And Mars gave me rebellious boldness.</p>
<p>My ascendant Taurus, with Mars therein –</p>
<p>Alas, alas, that ever love was sin!</p>
<p>I always followed my inclination,</p>
<p>By virtue of my constellation.</p>
<p>It made me so I could never withhold</p>
<p>My chamber of Venus from a fellow bold.</p>
<p>Yet have I Mars’ mark upon my face,</p>
<p>And also in another private place.</p>
<p>For, God wisely be my salvation,</p>
<p>I never loved with any discretion,</p>
<p>But ever followed my appetite,</p>
<p>Whether he was long, or short, or black or white.</p>
<p>I cared not, so long as he liked me,</p>
<p>How rich he was, nor of what degree.</p>
<p>What can I say, but at the month’s end,</p>
<p>This jolly clerk Jankin, my godsend,</p>
<p>Wedded me with great solemnity,</p>
<p>And him I gave the land and property</p>
<p>All that had been given to me before.</p>
<p>But after I repented of it full sore;</p>
<p>He would allow me nothing I held dear.</p>
<p>By God, he smote me once on the ear,</p>
<p>Because I tore a page from his book,</p>
<p>So that my ear was deaf from the stroke.</p>
<p>Stubborn I was, as is a lioness,</p>
<p>And with a tongue nagging to excess,</p>
<p>And walk I would, as I had done before,</p>
<p>From house to house, something he deplored.</p>
<p>About which he often times would preach,</p>
<p>And of the old Roman tales he’d teach –</p>
<p>How Simplicius Gallus left his wife,</p>
<p>And forsook her for the rest of his life,</p>
<p>Because he saw her hatless in the way,</p>
<p>As he looked out his door one fine day.</p>
<p>Another Roman, he told me his names,</p>
<p>Because his wife went to the summer Games</p>
<p>Without him knowing, he forsook her too.</p>
<p>And then would he to his Bible go anew</p>
<p>And seek that proverb of the Ecclesiast,</p>
<p>Where he commands and forbids, aghast:</p>
<p>“Man shall not suffer his wife to gad about.”</p>
<p>Then would he speak like this, without doubt:</p>
<p>“Whoever builds his house of willows,</p>
<p>And spurs his blind horse o’er the fallows,</p>
<p>And sees his wife a pilgrim to All Hallows,</p>
<p>Is worthy to be hanged on the gallows!”</p>
<p>But all for naught – I cared never a haw</p>
<p>For his proverbs, and his old saw,</p>
<p>Nor would I by him corrected be.</p>
<p>I hate him who my vice tells to me;</p>
<p>And so do more, God knows, of us than I!</p>
<p>He was enraged with me, fit to die;</p>
<p>I could not stand him in any case, alas.</p>
<p>Now will I tell you true, by Saint Thomas,</p>
<p>Why I tore that page out of his book,</p>
<p>From which my ear was deafened by his stroke.</p>
<p>He had a book that gladly night and day,</p>
<p>For his pleasure he would read always.</p>
<p>He called it <em>Theophrastus and Valerius</em> –</p>
<p>At which he used to laugh fit to bust.</p>
<p>And then there was some clerk at Rome,</p>
<p>A Cardinal, named Saint Jerome,</p>
<p>Who made a book against Jovinian;</p>
<p>In which book bound up was Tertullian,</p>
<p>With Chrysippus, Trotula, Heloise,</p>
<p>That was abbess not far from Paris,</p>
<p>And the parables of Solomon,</p>
<p>Ovid’s <em>Art of Love</em>, and many a one.</p>
<p>And all of these bound in the one volume,</p>
<p>And every night and day it was his custom,</p>
<p>When he had leisure and vacation</p>
<p>From other worldly occupation,</p>
<p>To read in this book of wicked wives.</p>
<p>He knew of them more legends and lives</p>
<p>Than there are of good wives in the Bible.</p>
<p>For trust me well, it is impossible</p>
<p>For any clerk to speak well of wives</p>
<p>Unless it is of holy saints’ lives,</p>
<p>Never of any other woman though.</p>
<p>Who wrote the histories, tell me who?</p>
<p>By God, if women had written the stories</p>
<p>As clerics have within their oratories,</p>
<p>They’d have written of men more wickedness</p>
<p>Than all the sons of Adam could redress!</p>
<p>The children of Venus and Mercury</p>
<p>In all their workings are contrary:</p>
<p>Mercury loves wisdom and science,</p>
<p>And Venus loves spending, revelry, and dance.</p>
<p>And because of their diverse disposition,</p>
<p>Each is in fall in the other’s exaltation;</p>
<p>So, God knows, Mercury is helpless,</p>
<p>In Pisces where exalted is Venus,</p>
<p>And Venus falls when Mercury is raised.</p>
<p>Therefore no woman is by cleric praised.</p>
<p>The clerk, when he is old, and cannot do</p>
<p>Of Venus’ works the worth of his old shoe,</p>
<p>Then sits he down and writes in his dotage</p>
<p>That women cannot be true in marriage!</p>
<p>But now to my purpose, as I told you,</p>
<p>How I was beaten for a book, all true.</p>
<p>One night Jankin, that was our sire,</p>
<p>Read his book, as he sat by the fire,</p>
<p>Of Eve first, that through her wickedness</p>
<p>Brought all mankind to wretchedness,</p>
<p>For which indeed was Jesus Christ slain,</p>
<p>Who purchased us with his heart’s-blood again.</p>
<p>Lo here, expressed of women may you find,</p>
<p>That woman was the bane of all mankind!</p>
<p>Then he read to me how Samson lost his hair:</p>
<p>Sleeping, his lover cut it with her shears,</p>
<p>Through which treason he lost both his eyes.</p>
<p>Then he read me, for I’ll tell no lies,</p>
<p>Of Hercules, Deianira, and the pyre</p>
<p>Where, through her, he set himself on fire.</p>
<p>Nor did he miss the sorrow and woe too</p>
<p>That Socrates had with his wives two –</p>
<p>How Xantippe poured piss over his head.</p>
<p>The foolish man sat still, as he were dead.</p>
<p>He wiped his head; no more dare say again,</p>
<p>But: “Ere the thunder stops, comes the rain.”</p>
<p>– Of Pasiphae, that was the Queen of Crete;</p>
<p>Out of maliciousness he thought that sweet –</p>
<p>Fie, speak no more, it is a grisly thing,</p>
<p>Of her fierce lust, and perverse liking!</p>
<p>– Of Clytemnestra, for her lechery</p>
<p>That made her husband die by treachery;</p>
<p>He read all that with great devotion.</p>
<p>He told me also on what occasion</p>
<p>Amphiaraus at Thebes lost his life;</p>
<p>My husband had the legend of his wife,</p>
<p>Eriphyle, who for a necklace of gold</p>
<p>Secretly to all the Greeks had told</p>
<p>Of her husband’s private hiding-place,</p>
<p>For which at Thebes he did misfortune taste.</p>
<p>Of Livia he told me, and Lucilia:</p>
<p>They both killed their husbands there,</p>
<p>The one for love, the other out of hate.</p>
<p>Livia her husband one evening late</p>
<p>Empoisoned, because she was his foe.</p>
<p>Lucilia, lascivious, loved hers so</p>
<p>That, to make him always of her think,</p>
<p>She gave him such a manner of love-drink</p>
<p>That he was dead ere it was the morrow –</p>
<p>And thus in every way husbands have sorrow.</p>
<p>Then he told me how one Latumius</p>
<p>Complained to his comrade Arrius,</p>
<p>That in his garden there grew a tree</p>
<p>On which he said that his wives three</p>
<p>Hanged themselves, for spite it was.</p>
<p>“Oh dear brother,” quoth this Arrius,</p>
<p>“Give me a cutting from that blessed tree,</p>
<p>And in my garden planted it shall be!”</p>
<p>Of wives of later date he also read,</p>
<p>How some had slain their husbands in their bed,</p>
<p>And let their lovers pleasure them all night,</p>
<p>While the corpse lay on the floor upright;</p>
<p>And some had driven nails through their brain,</p>
<p>While they were sleeping, and thus them slain.</p>
<p>Some had given them poison in their drink.</p>
<p>He spoke more harm than heart could think,</p>
<p>And with all that he knew more proverbs</p>
<p>Than in this world grow grass or herbs.</p>
<p>“Better,” quoth he, “that your habitation</p>
<p>Be with a lion or a foul dragon,</p>
<p>Than with a woman who will always chide.</p>
<p>Better,” quoth he, “high on the roof to abide,</p>
<p>Than with an angry wife down in the house;</p>
<p>They are so wicked and cantankerous</p>
<p>They hate what their husbands love,” he’d say,</p>
<p>“A woman always casts her shame away</p>
<p>When she casts off her smock,” and lo,</p>
<p>“A fair woman unless she’s chaste also,</p>
<p>Is like a gold ring in a sow’s nose.”</p>
<p>Who would think, or who could suppose</p>
<p>The woe, that in my heart was, and pain?</p>
<p>And when I say he did begin again</p>
<p>Reading of that cursed book all night,</p>
<p>All suddenly three leaves then did I</p>
<p>Pluck from his book, as he read and, weak</p>
<p>As I am, my fist so took him on the cheek</p>
<p>That in our fireplace he fell backward down.</p>
<p>And started up as does a raging lion,</p>
<p>And with his fist he struck me on the head,</p>
<p>That on the floor I lay as I were dead.</p>
<p>And when he saw how still that I lay,</p>
<p>He was aghast, and would have fled away,</p>
<p>Till at last I came to and raised my head.</p>
<p>“Oh, have you slain me, false thief,” I said,</p>
<p>“And for my land thus have you murdered me?</p>
<p>Ere I be dead, yet will I kiss thee!”</p>
<p>And near he came and knelt right down,</p>
<p>And said: “Dear sister, my Alison,</p>
<p>So help me God, I shall thee never smite.</p>
<p>That I have done so was your fault outright;</p>
<p>Forgive me yet, and that I do beseech.”</p>
<p>And once again I hit him on the cheek,</p>
<p>And said: “Thief, my vengeance thus I wreak!</p>
<p>Now will I die; I may no longer speak.”</p>
<p>But in the end, with care and much ado,</p>
<p>We came to an agreement did we two.</p>
<p>He gave the bridle all into my hand,</p>
<p>To me the governance of house and land,</p>
<p>And of his tongue and of his hand also,</p>
<p>And I made him burn his book of woe.</p>
<p>And when that I had gotten unto me</p>
<p>By mastery all the sovereignty,</p>
<p>And that he said: “Mine own true wife,</p>
<p>Do as you wish through all your term of life;</p>
<p>Guard your honour, and my good estate,”</p>
<p>After that day we had no more debate.</p>
<p>God help me so, I was as kind to him</p>
<p>As any wife from Denmark unto Inde,</p>
<p>And also true, and so was he to me.</p>
<p>I pray to God that sits in majesty,</p>
<p>To bless his soul, of His mercy dear!</p>
<p>Now will I say my tale, if you will hear.’</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Behold the words between the Summoner and Friar</em></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Friar laughed when he had heard all this;</p>
<p>‘Now dame,’ quoth he, ‘so send me joy and bliss,</p>
<p>This is a long preamble to a tale!’</p>
<p>And when the Summoner heard the Friar rail,</p>
<p>‘Lo,’ quoth the Summoner, ‘God’s arms two,</p>
<p>A Friar will interfere whatever you do!</p>
<p>Lo, good men, a fly and then a friar</p>
<p>Will fall in every dish and every fire!</p>
<p>What do you mean by your ‘preambulation’?</p>
<p>Come, amble, or trot, or sit, or stay in motion!</p>
<p>You’re hindering our sport in this manner.’</p>
<p>‘You think so, Sir Summoner,’ quoth the Friar.</p>
<p>‘Now, by my faith, I shall, before I go</p>
<p>Tell of a summoner a tale or so,</p>
<p>That all the folk shall laugh in this place.’</p>
<p>‘Now if not, Friar, I will curse your face,’</p>
<p>Quoth the Summoner, ‘and then curse me,</p>
<p>If I do not tell a tale or two or three,</p>
<p>Of Friars, ere I come to Sittingborne,</p>
<p>That will make your very heart go mourn,</p>
<p>For well I know your patience is all gone.’</p>
<p>Our Host cried: ‘Peace, and that anon!’</p>
<p>And said: ‘Let the woman tell her tale.</p>
<p>You bicker like folk full drunk on ale.</p>
<p>Come, dame, tell forth your tale, that will be best.’</p>
<p>‘All ready, sir,’ quoth she, ‘just as you wish,</p>
<p>If I have licence of this worthy Friar.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, dame,’ quoth he, ‘tell forth and I will hear.’</p>
<p></p>
<p><em><strong>Here ends the Wife of Bath’s Prologue and her Tale begins</strong></em></p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h4><span id="anchor_Toc163145571">The Wife of Bath’s Tale</span></h4>
<p></p>
<p>In the olden days of King Arthur,</p>
<p>Of whom Britons speak with great honour,</p>
<p>All this land was filled full with faerie.</p>
<p>The Elf-Queen with her fair company</p>
<p>Danced full oft in many a green mead.</p>
<p>That was the old opinion, as I read –</p>
<p>I speak of many hundred years ago.</p>
<p>But now no man sees elves I know,</p>
<p>For now the endless charity and prayers</p>
<p>Of limiters and other holy friars,</p>
<p>Who search every field and every stream</p>
<p>As thick as are the motes in a sun-beam,</p>
<p>Blessing halls, chambers, kitchens, bowers,</p>
<p>Cities, boroughs, castles and high towers,</p>
<p>Thorps, barns, cattle-sheds, and dairies –</p>
<p>This is why there are no longer faeries.</p>
<p>For wherever there used to walk an elf,</p>
<p>There walks now the limiter himself</p>
<p>In the noon-time and in the mornings,</p>
<p>And says his matins and his holy things</p>
<p>As he goes round his limitation’s bounds.</p>
<p>Women may go safely up and down;</p>
<p>In every bush or under every tree,</p>
<p>There is no incubus about but he,</p>
<p>And he will only do them dishonour.</p>
<p>And it so befell that this King Arthur</p>
<p>Had in his house a lusty bachelor</p>
<p>Who one day came riding from the river,</p>
<p>And it chanced that, alone as he was born,</p>
<p>He saw a maiden walking there at dawn,</p>
<p>Of which maid, no matter how she pled,</p>
<p>By very force he stole her maidenhead;</p>
<p>Which oppression raised so great a clamour</p>
<p>And such petitions to King Arthur</p>
<p>That this knight was condemned as dead</p>
<p>Bu court of law and set to lose his head –</p>
<p>Peradventure, such was the statute though –</p>
<p>But that the Queen and other ladies so</p>
<p>Prayed the King for so long for his grace</p>
<p>That he his life granted him in its place,</p>
<p>And gave him to the Queen, to do her will,</p>
<p>To choose whether she would save or kill.</p>
<p>The Queen thanked the King with all her might;</p>
<p>And after thus she spoke to the knight,</p>
<p>When she thought it right, upon a day,</p>
<p>‘You yet stand,’ quoth she, ‘in such array</p>
<p>That of your life you yet shall have no surety.</p>
<p>I grant you life though, if you can tell me</p>
<p>What thing it is that women most desire.</p>
<p>Beware and keep your neck from axe’s ire!</p>
<p>And if you cannot tell me now anon,</p>
<p>Yet I will give you leave to be gone</p>
<p>A twelve-month and a day, and everywhere</p>
<p>Seek answer sufficient to this matter there.</p>
<p>And surety will I have, before you ride a pace,</p>
<p>That you return in person to this place.’</p>
<p>Woe was this knight, and sorrowfully mired,</p>
<p>But then, he might not do as he desired.</p>
<p>And at the last he chose to go and wend,</p>
<p>And come again, right at the year’s end,</p>
<p>With such answer as God would him purvey;</p>
<p>And so took leave and wended on his way.</p>
<p>He sought at every house in every place</p>
<p>Wherever he had hopes of finding grace,</p>
<p>To learn what thing women love the most;</p>
<p>But could not find by inland field or coast</p>
<p>Any one solution to this matter</p>
<p>On which two creatures agreed together.</p>
<p>Some said women had most love of riches;</p>
<p>Some said honour, some said happiness;</p>
<p>Some rich array, some said lust abed,</p>
<p>And oft times to be widowed and to wed.</p>
<p>Some said that our heart is most eased</p>
<p>When we are flattered most and pleased.</p>
<p>(I cannot lie! He’s very near reality;</p>
<p>A man may win us best by flattery;</p>
<p>And with attention, all the business,</p>
<p>Are we best snared, the great and less.)</p>
<p>And some said that we love best</p>
<p>To be free, and do as we’re possessed,</p>
<p>And that no man reprove us of our vice,</p>
<p>But claim we are not fools but somewhat wise.</p>
<p>For truly there is none at all among us,</p>
<p>If anyone on some sore spot will rub us</p>
<p>That will not kick if he tells the truth.</p>
<p>Try, and you will find it so, in sooth.</p>
<p>For, be we ever so vicious within,</p>
<p>We would be held as wise and free of sin.</p>
<p>And some said that great delight have we</p>
<p>In being thought dependable, discreet,</p>
<p>Steadfastly maintaining our purpose well,</p>
<p>And not betraying things that some might tell –</p>
<p>But value that at less than a rake-handle!</p>
<p>Woman’s discretion isn’t worth a candle;</p>
<p>Witness old Midas – will you hear the tale?</p>
<p>Ovid, amongst his great and small ale,</p>
<p>Says Midas had, under his long hair,</p>
<p>Upon his head two ass’s ears there;</p>
<p>The which deformity he hid from sight</p>
<p>Of every man, as subtly as he might,</p>
<p>That save his wife, none knew it was so.</p>
<p>He loved her best, and trusted her also;</p>
<p>He begged her that to no creature</p>
<p>She would tell of this sad feature.</p>
<p>She swore ‘no’, for all the world to win,</p>
<p>She would not do such villainy and sin,</p>
<p>As to gain her husband so foul a name;</p>
<p>She would not tell she said out of shame.</p>
<p>But nevertheless she almost died</p>
<p>At having this secret so long to hide.</p>
<p>She felt it swell so sore about her heart</p>
<p>That some word was sure from her to start.</p>
<p>And since she dared tell it to no man,</p>
<p>Down the marsh close nearby she ran –</p>
<p>Till she reached it her heart was all afire –</p>
<p>And as a bittern booms in the mire,</p>
<p>She laid her mouth to the water down.</p>
<p>‘Betray me not, water, with your sound!’</p>
<p>Quoth she, ‘I tell it now, but just to you:</p>
<p>My husband has long ass’s ears two!</p>
<p>Now is my heart all whole; now is it out.</p>
<p>I could no longer hide it, have no doubt.’</p>
<p>Here you see, that we can for a time abide,</p>
<p>Yet out it must; we can no secret hide.</p>
<p>The remainder of the tale, if you would hear,</p>
<p>Read Ovid, and you will find it there.</p>
<p>The knight of whom my tale tells specially,</p>
<p>When he saw he could not find out easily –</p>
<p>That is to say, what women love the most –</p>
<p>Within his breast full sorrowful was his ghost.</p>
<p>But home he goes; he could not make sojourn;</p>
<p>The day was come when homeward he must turn.</p>
<p>And on his way back he happened to ride,</p>
<p>Full of his cares, under a forest side,</p>
<p>Where he saw dancing on woodland floor</p>
<p>Of ladies four and twenty, and yet more.</p>
<p>Towards the which dance he began to turn,</p>
<p>In hope that some wisdom he might learn.</p>
<p>But certainly, before he was fully there,</p>
<p>Vanished was the dance; he knew not where.</p>
<p>No creature saw he that showed sign of life,</p>
<p>Save, sitting on the green, an old wife –</p>
<p>A fouler one than her might none devise.</p>
<p>Against the knight this wife began to rise</p>
<p>And said: ‘Sir knight, here there lies no way.</p>
<p>Tell me what you are seeking, by your faith!</p>
<p>Peradventure it might be better thus for thee;</p>
<p>This old woman knows many things,’ quoth she.</p>
<p>‘My dear mother,’ quoth the knight, ‘for certain</p>
<p>I am a dead man, unless I can show plain</p>
<p>What thing it is that women most desire.</p>
<p>Should you enlighten me, I’d pay your hire.’</p>
<p>‘Plight me your troth, here by my hand,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘That the next thing I require of thee</p>
<p>You shall do, if it lies within your might,</p>
<p>And I will tell you of it ere it be night.’</p>
<p>‘Here, by my truth!’ quoth the knight, ‘Agreed.’</p>
<p>‘Then,’ quoth she, ‘I dare boast readily</p>
<p>Your life is safe, for I will stand thereby.</p>
<p>Upon my life, the Queen will speak as I.</p>
<p>Let’s see if then the proudest of them all</p>
<p>That wears a head-cloth or a gemmed caul</p>
<p>Dare say nay to that which I shall teach.</p>
<p>Let us go on without longer speech.’</p>
<p>Then she whispered something in his ear,</p>
<p>And bade him to be glad and have no fear.</p>
<p>When they had reached the court, this knight</p>
<p>Declared he had kept his promise, to the night,</p>
<p>And ready was his answer, as he said.</p>
<p>Full many a noble wife and many a maid</p>
<p>And many a widow – since they are wise –</p>
<p>And the Queen herself, sitting in justice high,</p>
<p>Were assembled his answer there to hear;</p>
<p>And in a while the knight was bade appear.</p>
<p>Of everyone demanded was their silence,</p>
<p>And that the knight should tell his audience</p>
<p>What thing that worldly women love the best.</p>
<p>The knight forbore to stand there like a beast,</p>
<p>But to her question swiftly answered her</p>
<p>In manly voice, so all the court could hear.</p>
<p>‘My liege lady, generally,’ quoth he,</p>
<p>Women desire the self-same sovereignty</p>
<p>Over a husband as they do a lover,</p>
<p>And to hold mastery, he not above her.</p>
<p>That is your great desire, though you me kill;</p>
<p>Do as you wish; I am at your will.’</p>
<p>In all the court there was nor wife nor maid</p>
<p>Nor widow who could challenge what he said,</p>
<p>But said that he was worthy to have his life.</p>
<p>And at that word up started the old wife</p>
<p>Whom the knight had found sitting on the green.</p>
<p>‘Mercy, ‘quoth she, ‘my sovereign lady queen;</p>
<p>Ere that your court depart, see me aright.</p>
<p>I taught this answer to this same knight,</p>
<p>For which he plighted me his troth entire,</p>
<p>That the first thing I should of him require</p>
<p>He would do, if it lay within his might.</p>
<p>Before the court then, pray I you, sir knight,’</p>
<p>Quoth she, ‘that you take me as your wife,</p>
<p>For you know well that I have saved your life.</p>
<p>If I say false, say so, upon your faith.’</p>
<p>The knight answered, ‘Alas and well-away!</p>
<p>I know right well that such was my behest.</p>
<p>For God’s love, now choose a fresh request!</p>
<p>Take all my goods, and let my body go.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, then,’ quoth she, ‘A curse upon us two!</p>
<p>For though that I be foul and old and poor,</p>
<p>I wish not, for all the metal and the ore</p>
<p>That is buried under earth or lies above,</p>
<p>For aught but to be your wife, and your love.’</p>
<p>‘My love!’ quoth he, ‘nay, my damnation!</p>
<p>Alas, that any of my nation</p>
<p>Should ever be disgraced so foully!’</p>
<p>But all for naught; the end is this, that he</p>
<p>Had little choice; he needs must her wed,</p>
<p>And take his old wife, and go to bed.</p>
<p>Now some men would say, peradventure,</p>
<p>That in my negligence I make no feature</p>
<p>Of all the joy there was and the array</p>
<p>That at the feast appeared that very day.</p>
<p>To which thing briefly I answer shall:</p>
<p>I say, there was no joy or feast at all;</p>
<p>There was only heaviness and much sorrow.</p>
<p>For secretly he wedded her that morrow,</p>
<p>And all day after hid him like an owl;</p>
<p>Such woe was on him – with a wife so foul.</p>
<p>Great was the woe the knight had in his thought</p>
<p>When he was with his wife to bed there brought;</p>
<p>He thrashed about and twisted to and fro.</p>
<p>His old wife lay smiling broadly though,</p>
<p>And said: ‘O dear husband, <em>benedicitee</em>!</p>
<p>Does every knight do with his wife as thee?</p>
<p>Is this the law about King Arthur’s house?</p>
<p>Is every knight of his so mean a louse?</p>
<p>I am your own love, and then your wife;</p>
<p>I am she who has saved your life,</p>
<p>And, for sure, I have served you right.</p>
<p>Why do you thus with me this first night?</p>
<p>You act as would a man who’d lost his wit!</p>
<p>What is my sin? For God’s love, tell me it,</p>
<p>And it shall be amended, if I may.’</p>
<p>‘Amended,’ quoth the knight, ‘Alas, nay, nay!</p>
<p>It cannot be amended evermore.</p>
<p>You are so ugly, and so old, and more</p>
<p>You come also of such a lowly kin,</p>
<p>That little wonder is I thrash and spin.</p>
<p>God, would the heart but burst in my breast!’</p>
<p>‘Is this,’ quoth she, ‘the cause of your unrest?’</p>
<p>Yes,’ quoth he, what wonder all’s amiss?’</p>
<p>‘Now, sire,’ quoth she, ‘I could amend all this,</p>
<p>If I wished, before we have seen days three,</p>
<p>If you would but bear yourself well towards me.</p>
<p>If you all think by speaking of nobleness</p>
<p>Such as has descended from old riches,</p>
<p>That therefore it makes you noble men,</p>
<p>Such arrogance is not worth a hen.</p>
<p>Look for the most virtuous man always,</p>
<p>In private and public, who sees his way</p>
<p>To doing the noblest deeds that he can,</p>
<p>There will you find the greatest gentleman.</p>
<p>Christ wills we take from him our gentleness,</p>
<p>Not from our ancestors, despite their riches.</p>
<p>For though they leave us all their heritage,</p>
<p>From which we claim noble parentage,</p>
<p>Yet can they still bequeath us nothing</p>
<p>Not one of us, of their virtuous living,</p>
<p>That made them gentlemen in name to be,</p>
<p>Who bade us follow them in that degree.</p>
<p>Well has the wise poet of Florence,</p>
<p>Dante, I mean, spoken in this same sense –</p>
<p>Lo, in such verse Dante’s tale advances:</p>
<p>“Seldom arises by his slender branches</p>
<p>Man’s prowess, for God, of his goodness,</p>
<p>Wills that of him we claim our gentleness.”</p>
<p>For from our elders we can nothing claim</p>
<p>But temporal things, which may hurt and maim.</p>
<p>And everyone knows this as well as me:</p>
<p>If nobility were implanted naturally</p>
<p>In a certain lineage down the line,</p>
<p>Publicly, privately then the vine</p>
<p>Of noble work would be evergreen;</p>
<p>They would enact no vice or villainy.</p>
<p>Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house</p>
<p>Between here and the distant Caucasus,</p>
<p>And let men shut the doors and return,</p>
<p>Yet will the fire remain there and burn</p>
<p>As if twenty thousand did it behold.</p>
<p>Its natural office it will ever hold,</p>
<p>On peril of my life, until it die.</p>
<p>Thus you may see how the noble eye</p>
<p>Is not wedded to possession,</p>
<p>Since folk do not maintain its function</p>
<p>Forever, as does fire, lo, of its kind.</p>
<p>For, God knows, men will often find</p>
<p>A lord’s son acting shameful villainy.</p>
<p>And he who wants to claim nobility</p>
<p>Because he was born of a noble house,</p>
<p>His ancestors noble and virtuous,</p>
<p>And yet himself has done no noble deeds,</p>
<p>Nor followed his noble ancestors deceased,</p>
<p>He is not noble, be he duke or earl,</p>
<p>For base sinful deeds make the churl.</p>
<p>While mere renown makes gentility,</p>
<p>Your ancestors and their great bounty,</p>
<p>Which is external and not your own;</p>
<p>Your nobility comes from God alone.</p>
<p>Thus comes our own nobility by grace;</p>
<p>Not bequeathed to us by rank and place.</p>
<p>Think how noble, as says Valerius,</p>
<p>Was that Tullius Hostilius,</p>
<p>Who rose from poverty to high status,</p>
<p>Read Seneca and read Boethius,</p>
<p>There is it both expressed and agreed</p>
<p>That he is noble who does noble deeds.</p>
<p>And therefore, dear husband, I conclude</p>
<p>Although my ancestry is rough and rude,</p>
<p>Yet may God on high, I hope, may He</p>
<p>Grant me the grace to live virtuously.</p>
<p>Thus am I noble, when I first begin</p>
<p>To live in virtue, and abandon sin.</p>
<p>And in that you my poverty reprove,</p>
<p>The God whom we believe in and love,</p>
<p>In wilful poverty chose to live his life.</p>
<p>And surely, every man, maid or wife</p>
<p>Understands that Jesus, Heaven’s King,</p>
<p>Could yield of his life no vicious thing.</p>
<p>Honest poverty is fine, that’s certain:</p>
<p>This, Seneca and other clerks maintain.</p>
<p>The man content with poverty, I assert</p>
<p>That man is rich, although he lacks a shirt.</p>
<p>He that covets wealth is all the poorer</p>
<p>For he would have what is not in his power.</p>
<p>But he who has naught, yet does not crave,</p>
<p>Is rich, although you hold him but a knave.</p>
<p>True poverty sings, in reality.</p>
<p>Juvenal says of poverty appositely:</p>
<p>“The poor man, as he goes on his way</p>
<p>Beside the thief, may ever sing and play.”</p>
<p>Poverty though hateful’s good nonetheless</p>
<p>In that it is a great release from business;</p>
<p>A great augmenter too of sapience,</p>
<p>To the man accepting it with patience.</p>
<p>Poverty, though it seems second best,</p>
<p>Is a possession no man can contest.</p>
<p>Poverty, often, when a man is humble</p>
<p>Leads him to God, and to himself as well.</p>
<p>Poverty is a glass, it seems to me,</p>
<p>Through which he may his true friends see.</p>
<p>And thus, sire, since I wish no grief to you,</p>
<p>Of my poverty show no more reproof.</p>
<p>Now, sire, of being old you reprove me;</p>
<p>And certainly, though no authority</p>
<p>Were found in books, yet men of honour</p>
<p>Say that you should show an old man favour,</p>
<p>And call him father, out of courteousness;</p>
<p>And authors too say so, as I would guess.</p>
<p>Now then you say that I am foul and old,</p>
<p>Well then you need not fear to be cuckold.</p>
<p>For poverty and old age, you must agree,</p>
<p>Are great guardians of chastity.</p>
<p>Yet nonetheless, since I know your delight,</p>
<p>I shall fulfil your worldly appetite.</p>
<p>Choose now,’ quoth she, ‘which of these to try:</p>
<p>To see me old and ugly till I die,</p>
<p>And be to you a true and humble wife,</p>
<p>Who never will displease you all my life,</p>
<p>Or else you may have me young and fair,</p>
<p>And take the risk that all those who repair</p>
<p>To our house are there because of me,</p>
<p>And to other places, it well may be.</p>
<p>Now choose, yourself, just as you like.’</p>
<p>The knight thought deeply and with a sigh</p>
<p>At last he replied to her in this manner:</p>
<p>‘My lady and my love, and wife so dear,</p>
<p>I place myself in your wise governance.</p>
<p>Choose yourself which is the most pleasant,</p>
<p>And brings most honour to me and you.</p>
<p>I do not care which it is of the two,</p>
<p>For as you like it, that suffices me.’</p>
<p>‘Then have I won the mastery,’ quoth she,</p>
<p>‘Since I may choose and govern as I wish?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, surely, wife,’ quoth he, ‘I hold that best.’</p>
<p>‘Kiss me,’ quoth she, ‘and no more wrath.</p>
<p>For, by my troth, I to you will be both –</p>
<p>That is to say, both fair and good.</p>
<p>I pray to God I shall die mad, and would,</p>
<p>If I be not to you both good and true</p>
<p>As ever wife was, since the world was new.</p>
<p>And if I be not tomorrow as fair to see</p>
<p>As any lady, Empress or Queen may be,</p>
<p>Who lives between the east and the west,</p>
<p>Do what you wish touching my life and death.</p>
<p>Lift the curtain; see what already is.’</p>
<p>And when the knight swiftly saw all this,</p>
<p>That she was young, and lovely too,</p>
<p>For joy he took her in his arms two.</p>
<p>His heart was bathed in a bath of bliss;</p>
<p>A thousand times in a row they kiss,</p>
<p>And she obeyed him in everything</p>
<p>That pleased him and was to his liking.</p>
<p>And thus they lived to their lives end</p>
<p>In perfect joy – and Jesus Christ us send</p>
<p>Husbands meek, young, and fresh abed,</p>
<p>And grace to outlive those that we wed.</p>
<p>And also I pray Jesus, trim the lives</p>
<p>Of those who won’t be governed by their wives,</p>
<p>Those old and angry, grudging all expense,</p>
<p>God send them soon indeed the pestilence!</p>
