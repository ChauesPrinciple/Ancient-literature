            <dt>Abject</dt>
            <dd>Abject is defined as being "brought low, miserable; craven, degraded, despicable, self-abasing." Abjection is a "state of misery or degradation." However, these definitions are somewhat ambiguous and intangible. Thus, it is useful to consider how abjection is expressed. Religious abhorrence, incest, women's bodies, human sacrifice, bodily waste, death are examples of the abject because they are part of us but also something we wish to push away.</dd>

            <dd>According to Baldick, “The repetition of the same sounds—usually initial consonants of words or of stressed syllabus—in any sequence of neighboring words” (Baldick 6). Alliteration is typically used to convey a specific tone or message.</dd>

            <dt>Allusion</dt>
            <dd>When a text references, incorporates, or responds to an earlier piece (including literature, art, music, film, event, etc). T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land (1922) offers an extensive example of allusion in literature. According to Baldick, “The technique of allusion is an economical means of calling upon the history or the literary tradition that author and reader are assumed to share” (7).</dd>

            <dd>“a resonant figure of mythic importance, whether a personality, place, or situation, found in diverse cultures and different historical periods” (Mickics 24). Archetypes differ from allegories because they tend to reference broader or commonplace (often termed “stock”) character types, plot points, and literary conventions. Paying attention to archetypes can help readers identify what an author may posit as “universal truths” about life, society, human interaction, etc. based on what other authors or participants in a culture may have said about them.</dd>

        <div class="glossary-item">

            <dd>‘aristeia’ comes from the Greek adjective, ‘aristos,’ meaning ‘best.’ Similarly, ‘aristeuo’ means ‘to be the best.’ Following this etymology, ‘aristeia’ would mean ‘the moment of being the best,’ or ‘moment of glory.’</dd>

        <div class="glossary-item">
            <dt>Catharsis</dt>
            <dd>meaning “cleansing” in Greek, refers to a literary theory first developed by the philosopher Aristotle, who believed that cleansing our emotions was the purpose of a good story, especially a tragedy. Catharsis applies to any form of art or media that makes us feel strong negative emotions, but that we are nonetheless drawn to – we may seek out art that creates these emotions because the experience purges the emotions from our system. We can feel something intense, then walk out of the theater feeling better afterwards. Catharsis is roughly synonymous with the idea of “blowing off steam.”</dd>

            <dt>Chivalric</dt>
            <dd>or the chivalric code, is a code of conduct associated with the medieval institution of knighthood. Chivalry arose from an idealized German custom. It developed first in the north of France among horse soldiers who served in Charlemagne′s heavy cavalry. It was originally conceived of as an aristocratic warrior code — the term derives from the French term chevalerie, meaning horse soldiery — involving gallantry, individual training, and service to others.</dd>

            <dd>a relationship that benefited both noblemen and freemen. According to the comitatus relationship, nobleman provided the freemen with land in exchange for protection and loyalty. For freemen, it was an opportunity to rise in social status while the nobility gained protection and loyalty. Eventually, the freemen became known as thanes. The thane must agree to defend the king or nobleman to his death if necessary. In return, the nobility shared their wealth and provided weapons. Perhaps more important is the mutual respect, friendship, and honor that the nobility and thanes shared.</dd>

            <dd>a medieval European literary conception of love that emphasized nobility and chivalry.

Examples of stories with frame narratives include Canterbury Tales, Frankenstein, and Hubris: the sort of pride that is so inflated that it binds, even destroys a character, even an entire people. Many characters in classical literature and Shakespeare's plays are so prideful that it destroys them; so is Satan in Milton's Paradise Lost. “like” or “as.”</dd>

This applies to all texts: novels, works of philosophy, newspaper articles, films, songs, paintings, etc. To understand intertextuality, it’s crucial to understand this broad definition of the word “text.” Every text is affected by all the texts that came before it, since those texts influenced the author’s thinking and aesthetic choices.
