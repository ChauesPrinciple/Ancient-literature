<h1>Song of Roland</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Roland's Oliphant</p>
<p>The <em>Song of Roland</em> is the oldest surviving French medieval romance and epic poem.<em> </em>It was written down between 1140 and 1170 AD but told of actual events that occurred on August 15, 778 AD.</p>
<p>The poem is based on a historical incident, the Battle of Roncesvaux Pass, in which the rearguard of Charlemagne's withdrawing Franks, the French forces, escorting a rich collection of plunder gathered during a campaign in Spain, was attacked by pagans (non-Christians/Muslims). In this battle, recorded by the contemporary historian and biographer <strong>Einhard</strong> in his <em>Life of Charlemagne</em> (written around 830), every one of the trapped soldiers was slaughtered, including Roland.</p>
<p>Before his honorable death in battle, however, Roland represents the stages of the Hero’s Journey and many heroic archetypes. He demonstrates what it means to be a chivalrous knight – loyal to his king and country to the very end, overcoming his character flaw, and sacrificing himself for the greater good in the end.  His story is the embodiment of medieval romance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the composer of the poem got nearly all the historical facts surrounding Roland’s defeat and death incorrect:</p>
<p>The bandits who slaughtered the rearguard of the French were Basques, not Saracens.</p>
<p>The invasion of the Spanish moors was brief, not a seven-year-long war.</p>
<p>Revenge for the ambush was never carried out. </p>
<p>There was never a rivalry between Roland and Ganelon; Ganelon and Roland likely were not even alive at the same time.</p>
<p>And… Charlemagne was not the emperor (at the time of poem composition).</p>
<p>Roland’s historically accurate battle occurred on August 15, 778 while the <em>Song of Roland</em> was written between 1098 and 1100 AD, so there was a substantial time gap between the two events.</p>
<p>Charlemagne invaded Spain in 778, intending to seize the city of Saragossa (Zaragoza) in northern Spain.  On his way there, he had traveled through Basque lands, plundering, looting, and pillaging as he passed. On Charlemagne's return to France, on the afternoon of August 15, 778, the Basques attacked his rearguard and slaughtered the force to a man at Roncesvalles (Roncesvalles, Roncesvaux), which is somewhere in the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain—the exact location remains in dispute.  Einhard only describes the incident briefly in his notes on the Spanish expedition (it will be quoted in the analysis). According to Einhard, a few nobles were killed, including "Hrudoland [Roland], lord of the Marches of Brittany."</p>
<p>It is unclear what impact the disaster had on Charlemagne's plans. As it merited few words from Einhard, one is tempted to conclude that it was minor and did not really hinder Charlemagne's military campaigns. However, it did delay his establishment of a Spanish March by almost a decade and allow Saragossa to remain an independent emirate while the Basques remained an independent force (because of succeeding battles).</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <em>Song of Roland</em> is one of the most popular medieval epics of French literature. The poem takes the historical Battle of Roncesvalles (Roncevaux) in 778 as its subject. The epic itself became widely popular and was later romanticized as a conflict between Christians and Muslims during the Crusades. <em>Song of Roland</em> is also considered the oldest epic in French Literature and to some the embodiment of the greatest medieval romances.</p>
<p>Charlemagne's army is fighting the Muslims in Spain. The last city standing is Saragossa, held by the Muslim king Marsilla. Terrified of the might of Charlemagne's army of Franks, Marsilla sends out messengers to Charlemagne, promising treasure and Marsilla's conversion to Christianity if the Franks will go back to France. Charlemagne and his men are tired of fighting and decide to accept this peace offer. They now need to select a messenger to go back to Marsilla's court. The bold warrior Roland nominates Ganelon. Angry because Roland proposes him for the dangerous task, Ganelon plots with the Saracens to achieve Roland’s destruction through betrayal. On his return, Ganelon ensures that Roland will command the rearguard of the army when it withdraws from Spain. </p>
<p>As the Frankish army crosses the Pyrenees, the rearguard is surrounded at the pass of Roncesvalles by an overwhelming Saracen force. The wise and moderate Olivier and the fierce archbishop Turpin are among the men Roland picks to join him. Seeing that they are badly outnumbered, Olivier asks Roland to blow on his <strong>oliphant</strong> to call the main body of the Frankish army to reinforce them. Roland proudly refuses to do so, claiming that they need no help and that the rearguard can defeat the “pagan hordes.” While the Franks fight magnificently, there is no way they can continue to hold off against the Saracens. Almost all Roland’s men are dead, and he knows that it is too late for Charlemagne and his troops to save them, but he blows his oliphant anyway to warn the emperor about what happened to his men. Roland blows so hard that his temples burst. He dies a glorious martyr's death, and saints take his soul straight to Paradise. </p>
<p>When Charlemagne and his men reach the battlefield, Roland and his army are dead, the Saracens have fled, and the Franks pursue them in search of vengeance. The Frankish army chases them into the river Ebro, where they all drown. Meanwhile, the powerful emir of Babylon, Baligant, has arrived in Spain to help Marsilla. Baligant and his immense Muslim army ride after Charlemagne and his Christian army, meeting them on the battlefield at Roncesvalles, where the Christians are burying and mourning their dead. Both sides fight valiantly. </p>
<p>Charlemagne kills Baligant, however, and the remaining Saracen army flees. This means that Saragossa has no defenders left; the Franks take the city. With Marsilla's wife Bramimonde, Charlemagne and his men ride back to Aix, their capital in sweet France. The Franks, who have already discovered Ganelon's betrayal, keep him in chains until it is time for his trial. Ganelon makes the argument that his actions were a legitimate form of revenge, openly proclaimed, not treason. While the council of barons, which Charlemagne gathered to decide the traitor's fate, is initially swayed by this claim, one man, Thierry, argues that, because Roland was serving Charlemagne, Ganelon's actions constitute a betrayal of the emperor. The Franks are convinced by the result of the trial by combat that Ganelon is truly a villain and sentences him to a most painful death. The story does not end, however, without the conversion of Marsilla’s wife, Bramimonde, to Christianity and Charlamagne being visited by Gabriel to drive home the righteousness of the Frankish crusade. </p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>The Battle of Roncevaux</p>
<p>As we position ourselves to analyze the <em>Song of Roland</em>, it is important to keep a certain sympathetic perspective: the Spain that Roland and Charlamagne are invading is the same Spain of our lovable Don Quixote. In fact, the very “pagan” Muslims Roland refers to are likely from the same Moorish community that produced the <em>Arabic</em> transcript from which Cervantes translated to produce the first edition of <em>Don Quixote</em>. </p>
<p>This historical context is important to us because the <em>Song of Roland</em> is a military text. More specifically, it is one of the earliest <strong>propagand</strong><strong>a</strong> military texts ever recorded for an empire. </p>
<p>How can we know it is propaganda?</p>
<p>Here is one definition of propaganda that I like:</p>
<p>Propaganda appears in a variety of forms. It is strategic and intentional as it aims to influence attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Propaganda can be beneficial or harmful. It may use truth, half-truths, or lies. To be successful, propaganda taps into our deepest values, fears, hopes, and dreams.</p>
<p>Steven Luckert and Susan Bachrach, authors of <em>The State of Deception</em>, 2009</p>
<p>So, what happened?</p>
<p>It is important to note that many consider the <em>Song of Roland</em> a beautiful epic, rich in culture and history. It is not that simple, however, and what began as an oral epic celebrating a great knight has been transformed, due to the application of politics, into something nefarious. As we know, the<em> Song of Roland</em> tells the story of the ambush of Charles the Great's rearguard in the Pyrenees <strong>in the year 778</strong>; or, as Charles’ biographer Einhard relates:</p>
<p>While the war against the Saxons is being fought energetically almost continuously, Charlamagne, having stationed troops at strategic places along the borders, attacks Spain with all the forces he can muster. He crosses the Pyrenees, accepts the surrender of all the towns and fortified places that he encounters along the way, and returns without his army having sustained any losses. Except that during the withdrawal, while traversing the Pyrenees, he happened to experience Gascon treachery. While His army was marching along column because of the narrow pass, and some Gascons lying in ambush at the top of the mountain, swoop down on the last elements of the baggage train and the rearguard protecting the main body of the army. They drive them back into the Valley, join battle, and massacre every one of them. </p>
<p>This historical incident is the basis for the old French epic poem. However, three hundred years of singing and recounting this incident in the halls where the Frankish Warriors spent their nights, or on their marches where they spent their days, or even on the battlefield at Hastings, have transformed the story into a profound reflection on the culture it represents. The semi-oral nature of the epic places the <em>Song of Roland</em> in a similar context as the <em>Iliad</em> concerning the Greeks and Troy: it was changed over centuries by epic poets into the remarkable story of the wrath of Achilles and therefore holds much of the same historical and emotional renown. </p>
<p>Our reading of the <em>Song of Roland</em> will not be that simple, of course. In recounting a scene from the text, Dr. Richard Smith notes one of the underlying themes of this text is that the “pagans” they have routed must burn and suffer; the Muslims (misrepresented purposely as “pagan,” despite being Abrahamic for propaganda purposes) would have been converted or killed, and this can be seen through the juxtaposition of Charles and his sycophants play gayly in a garden while the inhabitants suffer and die. He claims that: </p>
<p>“God rewards the Christian Franks and spares those Saracens who accept true religion. This is the message of the garden. On the other hand, <em>God will not spare those Saracen</em><em>s</em><em> who persist in false religion</em>. This is a message of Cardona’s smoking rubble.” </p>
<p>(My emphasis)</p>
<p>If we understand the poem the same way as Dr. Smith, then Turoldus, the poet, provides a positive symbol and symbolic structure for understanding Roland’s role in the poem. Like Dante in <em>The</em><em> Inferno</em>, Roland acts as a type of <strong>figure fulfi</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>lment</strong>, wherein he is representative of Isaac, or even Christ, to Charles's hoary personage, which resembles both Abraham and God. Roland plays the sacrificial son in this interpretation. Ganelon’s betrayal of Roland for a healthy annual subsidy from Marseilles is another figure fulfillment, but for Judas. Roland’s death on a Hill beneath the pine tree, flanked by two other trees, in a temple-like enclosure only underscores this correspondence.</p>
<p>Thus, in this view, Roland is there to become a sacrifice on behalf of the Frankish army, permitted by Charlemagne, just as Christ was a sacrifice for all humankind permitted by God. Moreover, Roland is a willing sacrifice who submits himself dutifully to Charles’ command. Thus, from the Christian and Frankish viewpoint, we can see how the biblical symbolism associated with the text and the realities of feudal society and warfare complement each other while restoring Roland’s heroic stature.</p>
<p>However, if we recall that the rest of the poem is about Charles’ revenge and that Roland’s sacrifice acts as a method for <strong>justifying the annihilation of the Saracens</strong>, it is easy to see how this “positive” reading is problematic. Consider that the oldest existing manuscript of the <em>S</em><em>ong of Roland</em>, which scholars call the Oxford manuscript, is in the Bodleian Library and dated to around the year 1100, why, then, might the author of the <em>Song of Roland</em> have written about a battle that took place in 778, between the Franks and the native Spanish Basque peoples (certainly not Islamic, but possibly “pagan”), as if it were in a different time, place, and in conflict with an altogether different enemy? </p>
<p>By the later part of the eleventh century, <em>when the </em><em>text that</em><em> we possess today was finally composed</em>, the historical essence of the story had pretty much disappeared. It was no longer a tale of Basque treachery and Roland's death; it had become a saga of Muslim-Christian enmity and French loyalty to the cause of France and the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Dr. Shay specifically speaks to the <em>Song of Roland</em>. He states:</p>
<p>The Judeo-Christian (and Islamic) world view has triumphed so completely over the Homeric world view that dishonoring the enemy now seems natural, virtuous, patriotic, pious. Yet, in the <em>Iliad</em>, only Achilles disrespects the enemy. In Homer’s world, this is not a natural but inhuman state into which Achilles has tragically fallen. Homer’s warriors are never weakened by respecting the enemy… [and] <strong>the </strong><strong>veteran’s self-respect never fully recovers so long as he is unable to see the enemy as worthy</strong>. </p>
<p>Demonizing the enemy leads directly to the “Betrayal of What’s Right” mentioned earlier within the text, a precursor for PTSD. Naturally, this prejudice goes both ways. Dr. Paul M. Cobb, Professor of Islamic History at the University of Pennsylvania, author of <em>Race for Paradise: An Islamic History of the Crusades</em>, notes in a History Channel interview that:</p>
<p>Most famously, there was an Arabic author named Ibrahim Ibn Ya’qub, who traveled around Europe in the 10th century, and his work was quoted by others. He left first-hand accounts of France, Italy, and Germany, among other places. We learn, for example, of the lushness of the land in Bordeaux, feasting practices in Germany, even whaling practices near Ireland. For all these, he was pleased by the land but appalled by the people he met. “They do not bathe except once or twice a year, with cold water,” he wrote. “They never wash their clothes, which they put on once for good until they fall into tatters.” What you have is a classic strategy by which one society “others” another society—much as Europeans did to Muslims.</p>
<p>He also draws the comparison between the Crusades and the Jihad:</p>
<p>There is a family resemblance because they share roots in monotheism, where God is a jealous God. And both Crusades and Jihad offered martyrdom to those who die. But while they look alike, they have some important differences. Crusades were directed at the liberation of the sacred land considered rightfully Christians, whereas Jihad was about rescuing souls.</p>
<p>With all of this information in mind, I hope that a picture has begun to form: as the Franks gear up for a second Crusade, the Frankish government co-opts a cherished historical tale into a propagandistic text meant to demonize the Islamic communities that live where the Franks want to invade and occupy (and this is something Americans will also do a bit later in history). Moreover, there is clear and obvious misinformation throughout the text: Muslims are not Pagan (in fact, the very idea that they would worship an idol is ludicrous), Roland was killed by Christian Basques, and the invasion had little to do with faith. </p>
<p>In the end, it seems as if politics affected not only the epic’s historical context but also the Christian message of honor and sacrifice that Roland originally represented.</p>
