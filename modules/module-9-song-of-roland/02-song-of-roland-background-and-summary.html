                <h1>Song of Roland</h1>

                <p>Roland's Oliphant</p>
                <p>The <em>Song of Roland</em> is the oldest surviving French medieval romance and epic poem.<em>
                    </em>It was written down between 1140 and 1170 AD but told of actual events that occurred on August
                    15, 778 AD.</p>
                <p>The poem is based on a historical incident, the Battle of Roncesvaux Pass, in which the rearguard of
                    Charlemagne's withdrawing Franks, the French forces, escorting a rich collection of plunder gathered
                    during a campaign in Spain, was attacked by pagans (non-Christians/Muslims). In this battle,
                    recorded by the contemporary historian and biographer <strong>Einhard</strong> in his <em>Life of
                        Charlemagne</em> (written around 830), every one of the trapped soldiers was slaughtered,
                    including Roland.</p>
                <p>Before his honorable death in battle, however, Roland represents the stages of the Hero’s Journey and
                    many heroic archetypes. He demonstrates what it means to be a chivalrous knight – loyal to his king
                    and country to the very end, overcoming his character flaw, and sacrificing himself for the greater
                    good in the end. His story is the embodiment of medieval romance.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the composer of the poem got nearly all the historical facts surrounding Roland’s
                    defeat and death incorrect:</p>
                <p>The bandits who slaughtered the rearguard of the French were Basques, not Saracens.</p>
                <p>The invasion of the Spanish moors was brief, not a seven-year-long war.</p>
                <p>Revenge for the ambush was never carried out. </p>
                <p>There was never a rivalry between Roland and Ganelon; Ganelon and Roland likely were not even alive
                    at the same time.</p>
                <p>And… Charlemagne was not the emperor (at the time of poem composition).</p>
                <p>Roland’s historically accurate battle occurred on August 15, 778 while the <em>Song of Roland</em>
                    was written between 1098 and 1100 AD, so there was a substantial time gap between the two events.
                </p>
                <p>Charlemagne invaded Spain in 778, intending to seize the city of Saragossa (Zaragoza) in northern
                    Spain. On his way there, he had traveled through Basque lands, plundering, looting, and pillaging as
                    he passed. On Charlemagne's return to France, on the afternoon of August 15, 778, the Basques
                    attacked his rearguard and slaughtered the force to a man at Roncesvalles (Roncesvalles,
                    Roncesvaux), which is somewhere in the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain—the exact
                    location remains in dispute. Einhard only describes the incident briefly in his notes on the Spanish
                    expedition (it will be quoted in the analysis). According to Einhard, a few nobles were killed,
                    including "Hrudoland [Roland], lord of the Marches of Brittany."</p>
                <p>It is unclear what impact the disaster had on Charlemagne's plans. As it merited few words from
                    Einhard, one is tempted to conclude that it was minor and did not really hinder Charlemagne's
                    military campaigns. However, it did delay his establishment of a Spanish March by almost a decade
                    and allow Saragossa to remain an independent emirate while the Basques remained an independent force
                    (because of succeeding battles).</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The <em>Song of Roland</em> is one of the most popular medieval epics of French literature. The poem
                    takes the historical Battle of Roncesvalles (Roncevaux) in 778 as its subject. The epic itself
                    became widely popular and was later romanticized as a conflict between Christians and Muslims during
                    the Crusades. <em>Song of Roland</em> is also considered the oldest epic in French Literature and to
                    some the embodiment of the greatest medieval romances.</p>
                <p>Charlemagne's army is fighting the Muslims in Spain. The last city standing is Saragossa, held by the
                    Muslim king Marsilla. Terrified of the might of Charlemagne's army of Franks, Marsilla sends out
                    messengers to Charlemagne, promising treasure and Marsilla's conversion to Christianity if the
                    Franks will go back to France. Charlemagne and his men are tired of fighting and decide to accept
                    this peace offer. They now need to select a messenger to go back to Marsilla's court. The bold
                    warrior Roland nominates Ganelon. Angry because Roland proposes him for the dangerous task, Ganelon
                    plots with the Saracens to achieve Roland’s destruction through betrayal. On his return, Ganelon
                    ensures that Roland will command the rearguard of the army when it withdraws from Spain. </p>
                <p>As the Frankish army crosses the Pyrenees, the rearguard is surrounded at the pass of Roncesvalles by
                    an overwhelming Saracen force. The wise and moderate Olivier and the fierce archbishop Turpin are
                    among the men Roland picks to join him. Seeing that they are badly outnumbered, Olivier asks Roland
                    to blow on his <strong>oliphant</strong> to call the main body of the Frankish army to reinforce
                    them. Roland proudly refuses to do so, claiming that they need no help and that the rearguard can
                    defeat the “pagan hordes.” While the Franks fight magnificently, there is no way they can continue
                    to hold off against the Saracens. Almost all Roland’s men are dead, and he knows that it is too late
                    for Charlemagne and his troops to save them, but he blows his oliphant anyway to warn the emperor
                    about what happened to his men. Roland blows so hard that his temples burst. He dies a glorious
                    martyr's death, and saints take his soul straight to Paradise. </p>
                <p>When Charlemagne and his men reach the battlefield, Roland and his army are dead, the Saracens have
                    fled, and the Franks pursue them in search of vengeance. The Frankish army chases them into the
                    river Ebro, where they all drown. Meanwhile, the powerful emir of Babylon, Baligant, has arrived in
                    Spain to help Marsilla. Baligant and his immense Muslim army ride after Charlemagne and his
                    Christian army, meeting them on the battlefield at Roncesvalles, where the Christians are burying
                    and mourning their dead. Both sides fight valiantly. </p>
                <p>Charlemagne kills Baligant, however, and the remaining Saracen army flees. This means that Saragossa
                    has no defenders left; the Franks take the city. With Marsilla's wife Bramimonde, Charlemagne and
                    his men ride back to Aix, their capital in sweet France. The Franks, who have already discovered
                    Ganelon's betrayal, keep him in chains until it is time for his trial. Ganelon makes the argument
                    that his actions were a legitimate form of revenge, openly proclaimed, not treason. While the
                    council of barons, which Charlemagne gathered to decide the traitor's fate, is initially swayed by
                    this claim, one man, Thierry, argues that, because Roland was serving Charlemagne, Ganelon's actions
                    constitute a betrayal of the emperor. The Franks are convinced by the result of the trial by combat
                    that Ganelon is truly a villain and sentences him to a most painful death. The story does not end,
                    however, without the conversion of Marsilla’s wife, Bramimonde, to Christianity and Charlamagne
                    being visited by Gabriel to drive home the righteousness of the Frankish crusade. </p>
