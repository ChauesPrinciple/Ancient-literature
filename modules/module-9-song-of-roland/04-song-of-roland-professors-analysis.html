                <p>As we position ourselves to analyze the <em>Song of Roland</em>, it is important to keep a certain
                    sympathetic perspective: the Spain that Roland and Charlemagne are invading is the same Spain of our
                    lovable Don Quixote. In fact, the very "pagan" Muslims Roland refers to are likely from the same
                    Moorish community that produced the <em>Arabic</em> transcript from which Cervantes translated to
                    produce the first edition of <em>Don Quixote</em>.</p>

                <div class="callout-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f8d7da 0%, #f5c6cb 100%); border-left: 4px solid #721c24; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Key Insight:</strong> This historical context is important because the
                        <em>Song of Roland</em> is a military text. More specifically, it is one of the earliest
                        <strong>propaganda</strong> military texts ever recorded for an empire.

                <h3>What is Propaganda?</h3>
                <p><em>How can we know it is propaganda?</em> Here is one definition:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">"Propaganda appears in a variety of forms. It is strategic and intentional as
                        it aims to influence attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Propaganda can be beneficial or
                        harmful. It may use truth, half-truths, or lies. To be successful, propaganda taps into our
                        deepest values, fears, hopes, and dreams."</p>

                <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                <p>It is important to note that many consider the <em>Song of Roland</em> a beautiful epic, rich in
                    culture and history. It is not that simple, however, and what began as an oral epic celebrating a
                    great knight has been transformed, due to the application of politics, into something nefarious. As
                    we know, the <em>Song of Roland</em> tells the story of the ambush of Charles the Great's rearguard
                    in the Pyrenees <strong>in the year 778</strong>; or, as Charles' biographer Einhard relates:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #e2e3e5; border-left: 4px solid #383d41; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">"While the war against the Saxons is being fought energetically almost
                        continuously, Charlemagne, having stationed troops at strategic places along the borders,
                        attacks Spain with all the forces he can muster. He crosses the Pyrenees, accepts the surrender
                        of all the towns and fortified places that he encounters along the way, and returns without his
                        army having sustained any losses. Except that during the withdrawal, while traversing the
                        Pyrenees, he happened to experience Gascon treachery. While His army was marching along column
                        because of the narrow pass, and some Gascons lying in ambush at the top of the mountain, swoop
                        down on the last elements of the baggage train and the rearguard protecting the main body of the
                        army. They drive them back into the Valley, join battle, and massacre every one of them."</p>
                    <footer style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: normal; color: #666;">— Einhard, <em>Life of
                            Charlemagne</em></footer>
                </blockquote>

                <p>This historical incident is the basis for the old French epic poem. However, three hundred years of
                    singing and recounting this incident in the halls where the Frankish Warriors spent their nights, or
                    on their marches where they spent their days, or even on the battlefield at Hastings, have
                    transformed the story into a profound reflection on the culture it represents. The semi-oral nature
                    of the epic places the <em>Song of Roland</em> in a similar context as the <em>Iliad</em> concerning
                    the Greeks and Troy: it was changed over centuries by epic poets into the remarkable story of the
                    wrath of Achilles and therefore holds much of the same historical and emotional renown.</p>

                <h3>The Problematic Reading</h3>
                <p>Our reading of the <em>Song of Roland</em> will not be that simple, of course. In recounting a scene
                    from the text, Dr. Richard Smith notes one of the underlying themes of this text is that the
                    "pagans" they have routed must burn and suffer; the Muslims (misrepresented purposely as "pagan,"
                    despite being Abrahamic for propaganda purposes) would have been converted or killed, and this can
                    be seen through the juxtaposition of Charles and his sycophants playing gaily in a garden while the
                    inhabitants suffer and die. He claims that:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">"God rewards the Christian Franks and spares those Saracens who accept true
                        religion. This is the message of the garden. On the other hand, <em>God will not spare those
                            Saracens who persist in false religion</em>. This is a message of Cardona's smoking rubble."
                    </p>
                    <footer style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: normal; color: #666;">— Dr. Richard Smith (emphasis
                        added)</footer>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Figure Fulfillment</h3>
                <p>If we understand the poem the same way as Dr. Smith, then Turoldus, the poet, provides a positive
                    symbol and symbolic structure for understanding Roland's role in the poem. Like Dante in <em>The
                        Inferno</em>, Roland acts as a type of <strong>figure fulfillment</strong>, wherein he is
                    representative of Isaac, or even Christ, to Charles's hoary personage, which resembles both Abraham
                    and God. Roland plays the sacrificial son in this interpretation. Ganelon's betrayal of Roland for a
                    healthy annual subsidy from Marseilles is another figure fulfillment, but for Judas. Roland's death
                    on a Hill beneath the pine tree, flanked by two other trees, in a temple-like enclosure only
                    underscores this correspondence.</p>

                <p>Thus, in this view, Roland is there to become a sacrifice on behalf of the Frankish army, permitted
                    by Charlemagne, just as Christ was a sacrifice for all humankind permitted by God. Moreover, Roland
                    is a willing sacrifice who submits himself dutifully to Charles' command. Thus, from the Christian
                    and Frankish viewpoint, we can see how the biblical symbolism associated with the text and the
                    realities of feudal society and warfare complement each other while restoring Roland's heroic
                    stature.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3cd 0%, #ffeeba 100%); border: 2px solid #856404; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; color: #856404;"><strong>However</strong>, if we recall that the rest of the
                        poem is about Charles' revenge and that Roland's sacrifice acts as a method for
                        <strong>justifying the annihilation of the Saracens</strong>, it is easy to see how this
                        "positive" reading is problematic.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>Consider that the oldest existing manuscript of the <em>Song of Roland</em>, which scholars call the
                    Oxford manuscript, is in the Bodleian Library and dated to around the year 1100. Why, then, might
                    the author of the <em>Song of Roland</em> have written about a battle that took place in 778,
                    between the Franks and the native Spanish Basque peoples (certainly not Islamic, but possibly
                    "pagan"), as if it were in a different time, place, and in conflict with an altogether different
                    enemy?</p>

                <p>By the later part of the eleventh century, <em>when the text that we possess today was finally
                        composed</em>, the historical essence of the story had pretty much disappeared. It was no longer
                    a tale of Basque treachery and Roland's death; it had become a saga of Muslim-Christian enmity and
                    French loyalty to the cause of France and the Catholic Church.</p>

                <h3>The Cost of Demonizing the Enemy</h3>
                <p>Dr. Shay specifically speaks to the <em>Song of Roland</em>. He states:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">"The Judeo-Christian (and Islamic) world view has triumphed so completely over
                        the Homeric world view that dishonoring the enemy now seems natural, virtuous, patriotic, pious.
                        Yet, in the <em>Iliad</em>, only Achilles disrespects the enemy. In Homer's world, this is not a
                        natural but inhuman state into which Achilles has tragically fallen. Homer's warriors are never
                        weakened by respecting the enemy… [and] <strong>the veteran's self-respect never fully recovers
                            so long as he is unable to see the enemy as worthy</strong>."</p>
                    <footer style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: normal; color: #666;">— Dr. Shay</footer>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Demonizing the enemy leads directly to the "Betrayal of What's Right" mentioned earlier within the
                    text, a precursor for PTSD. Naturally, this prejudice goes both ways. Dr. Paul M. Cobb, Professor of
                    Islamic History at the University of Pennsylvania, author of <em>Race for Paradise: An Islamic
                        History of the Crusades</em>, notes in a History Channel interview:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">"Most famously, there was an Arabic author named Ibrahim Ibn Ya'qub, who
                        traveled around Europe in the 10th century, and his work was quoted by others. He left
                        first-hand accounts of France, Italy, and Germany, among other places. We learn, for example, of
                        the lushness of the land in Bordeaux, feasting practices in Germany, even whaling practices near
                        Ireland. For all these, he was pleased by the land but appalled by the people he met. 'They do
                        not bathe except once or twice a year, with cold water,' he wrote. 'They never wash their
                        clothes, which they put on once for good until they fall into tatters.' What you have is a
                        classic strategy by which one society 'others' another society—much as Europeans did to
                        Muslims."</p>

                </blockquote>

                <p>He also draws the comparison between the Crusades and the Jihad:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #d4edda; border-left: 4px solid #28a745; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">"There is a family resemblance because they share roots in monotheism, where
                        God is a jealous God. And both Crusades and Jihad offered martyrdom to those who die. But while
                        they look alike, they have some important differences. <strong>Crusades were directed at the
                            liberation of the sacred land considered rightfully Christian</strong>, whereas
                        <strong>Jihad was about rescuing souls</strong>."

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>With all of this information in mind, I hope that a picture has begun to form: as the Franks gear up
                    for a second Crusade, the Frankish government co-opts a cherished historical tale into a
                    propagandistic text meant to demonize the Islamic communities that live where the Franks want to
                    invade and occupy (and this is something Americans will also do a bit later in history). Moreover,
                    there is clear and obvious misinformation throughout the text: Muslims are not Pagan (in fact, the
                    very idea that they would worship an idol is ludicrous), Roland was killed by Christian Basques, and
                    the invasion had little to do with faith.</p>

                <div class="conclusion-box"

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 0;"><strong>In the end, it seems as if politics affected not
                            only the epic's historical context but also the Christian message of honor and sacrifice
                            that Roland originally represented.</strong></p>
