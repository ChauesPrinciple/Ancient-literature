                    Full seven years hath sojourned in Spain,<br>
                    Conquered the land, and won the western main,<br>
                    Now no fortress against him doth remain,<br>
                    No city walls are left for him to gain,<br>
                    Save Sarraguce, that sits on high mountain.<br>
                    Marsile its King, who feareth not God's name,<br>
                    Mahumet's man, he invokes Apollin's aid,<br>
                    Nor wards off ills that shall to him attain.<br>

                    King Marsilies he lay at Sarraguce,<br>
                    Went he his way into an orchard cool;<br>
                    There on a throne he sate, of marble blue,<br>
                    Round him his men, full twenty thousand, stood.<br>
                    Called he forth then his counts, also his dukes:<br>
                    "My Lords, give ear to our impending doom:<br>
                    That Emperour, Charles of France the Douce,<br>
                    Into this land is come, us to confuse.<br>
                    I have no host in battle him to prove,<br>
                    Nor have I strength his forces to undo.<br>
                    Counsel me then, ye that are wise and true;<br>
                    Can ye ward off this present death and dule?"<br>
                    What word to say no pagan of them knew,<br>
                    Save Blancandrin, of th' Castle of Val Funde.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Blancandrins was a pagan very wise,<br>
                    In vassalage he was a gallant knight,<br>
                    First in prowess, he stood his lord beside.<br>
                    And thus he spoke: "Do not yourself affright!<br>
                    Yield to Carlun, that is so big with pride,<br>
                    Faithful service, his friend and his ally;<br>
                    Lions and bears and hounds for him provide,<br>
                    Thousand mewed hawks, sev'n hundred camelry;<br>
                    Silver and gold, four hundred mules load high;<br>
                    Fifty wagons his wrights will need supply,<br>
                    Till with that wealth he pays his soldiery.<br>
                    War hath he waged in Spain too long a time,<br>
                    To Aix, in France, homeward he will him hie.<br>
                    Follow him there before Saint Michael's tide,<br>
                    You shall receive and hold the Christian rite;<br>
                    Stand honour bound, and do him fealty.<br>
                    Send hostages, should he demand surety,<br>
                    Ten or a score, our loyal oath to bind;<br>
                    Send him our sons, the first-born of our wives;--<br>
                    An he be slain, I'll surely furnish mine.<br>
                    Better by far they go, though doomed to die,<br>
                    Than that we lose honour and dignity,<br>
                    And be ourselves brought down to beggary."<br>

                    IV
                </p>
                <p>
                    Says Blancandrins: "By my right hand, I say,<br>
                    And by this beard, that in the wind doth sway,<br>
                    The Frankish host you'll see them all away;<br>
                    Franks will retire to France their own terrain.<br>
                    When they are gone, to each his fair domain,<br>
                    In his Chapelle at Aix will Charles stay,<br>
                    High festival will hold for Saint Michael.<br>
                    Time will go by, and pass the appointed day;<br>
                    Tidings of us no Frank will hear or say.<br>
                    Proud is that King, and cruel his courage;<br>
                    From th' hostage he'll slice their heads away.<br>
                    Better by far their heads be shorn away,<br>
                    Than that ourselves lose this clear land of Spain,<br>
                    Than that ourselves do suffer grief and pain."<br>
                    "That is well said. So be it." the pagans say.

                    The council ends, and that King Marsilie<br>
                    Calleth aside Clarun of Balaguee,<br>
                    Estramarin and Eudropin his peer,<br>
                    And Priamun and Guarlan of the beard,<br>
                    And Machiner and his uncle Mahee,<br>
                    With Jouner, Malbien from over sea,<br>
                    And Blancandrin, good reason to decree:<br>
                    Ten hath he called, were first in felony.<br>
                    "Gentle Barons, to Charlemagne go ye;<br>
                    He is in siege of Cordres the city.<br>
                    In your right hands bear olive-branches green<br>
                    Which signify Peace and Humility.<br>
                    If you by craft contrive to set me free,<br>
                    Silver and gold, you'll have your fill of me,<br>
                    Manors and fiefs, I'll give you all your need."<br>
                    "We have enough," the pagans straight agree.<br>

                    King Marsilies, his council finishing,<br>
                    Says to his men: "Go now, my lords, to him,<br>
                    Olive-branches in your right hands bearing;<br>
                    Bid ye for me that Charlemagne, the King,<br>
                    In his God's name to shew me his mercy;<br>
                    Ere this new moon wanes, I shall be with him;<br>
                    One thousand men shall be my following;<br>
                    I will receive the rite of christening,<br>
                    Will be his man, my love and faith swearing;<br>
                    Hostages too, he'll have, if so he will."<br>
                    Says Blancandrins: "Much good will come of this."<br>

                <p>
                    Ten snow-white mules then ordered Marsilie,<br>
                    Gifts of a King, the King of Suatilie.<br>
                    Bridled with gold, saddled in silver clear;<br>
                    Mounted them those that should the message speak,<br>
                    In their right hands were olive-branches green.<br>
                    Came they to Charle, that holds all France in fee,<br>
                    Yet cannot guard himself from treachery.<br>

                <p>
                    Merry and bold is now that Emperour,<br>
                    Cordres he holds, the walls are tumbled down,<br>
                    His catapults have battered town and tow'r.<br>
                    Great good treasure his knights have placed in pound,<br>
                    Silver and gold and many a jewelled gown.<br>
                    In that city there is no pagan now<br>
                    But he been slain, or takes the Christian vow.<br>
                    The Emperour is in a great orchard ground<br>
                    Where Oliver and Rollant stand around,<br>
                    Sansun the Duke and Anseis the proud,<br>
                    Gefreid d'Anjou, that bears his gonfaloun;<br>
                    There too Gerin and Geriers are found.<br>
                    Where they are found, is seen a mighty crowd,<br>
                    Fifteen thousand, come out of France the Douce.<br>
                    On white carpets those knights have sate them down,<br>
                    At the game-boards to pass an idle hour;--<br>
                    Chequers the old, for wisdom most renowned,<br>
                    While fence the young and lusty bachelours.<br>
                    Beneath a pine, in eglantine embow'red,<br>
                    l Stands a fald-stool, fashioned of gold throughout;<br>
                    There sits the King, that holds Douce France in pow'r;<br>
                    White is his beard, and blossoming-white his crown,<br>
                    Shapely his limbs, his countenance is proud.<br>
                    Should any seek, no need to point him out.<br>
                    The messengers, on foot they get them down,<br>
                    And in salute full courteously they lout.

                <p>
                    The foremost word of all Blancandrin spake,<br>
                    And to the King: "May God preserve you safe,<br>
                    The All Glorious, to Whom ye're bound to pray!<br>
                    Proud Marsilies this message bids me say:<br>
                    Much hath he sought to find salvation's way;<br>
                    Out of his wealth meet presents would he make,<br>
                    Lions and bears, and greyhounds leashed on chain,<br>
                    Thousand mewed hawks, sev'n hundred dromedrays,<br>
                    Four hundred mules his silver shall convey,<br>
                    Fifty wagons you'll need to bear away<br>
                    Golden besants, such store of proved assay,<br>
                    Wherewith full tale your soldiers you can pay.<br>
                    Now in this land you've been too long a day<br>
                    Hie you to France, return again to Aix;<br>
                    Thus saith my Lord, he'll follow too that way."<br>
                    That Emperour t'wards God his arms he raised<br>
                    Lowered his head, began to meditate.<br>

                    That Emperour inclined his head full low;<br>
                    Hasty in speech he never was, but slow:<br>
                    His custom was, at his leisure he spoke.<br>
                    When he looks up, his face is very bold,<br>
                    He says to them: "Good tidings have you told.<br>
                    King Marsilies hath ever been my foe.<br>
                    These very words you have before me told,<br>
                    In what measure of faith am I to hold?"<br>
                    That Sarrazin says, "Hostages he'll show;<br>
                    Ten shall you take, or fifteen or a score.<br>
                    Though he be slain, a son of mine shall go,<br>
                    Any there be you'll have more nobly born.<br>
                    To your palace seigneurial when you go,<br>
                    At Michael's Feast, called in periculo;<br>
                    My Lord hath said, thither will he follow<br>
                    Ev'n to your baths, that God for you hath wrought;<br>
                    There is he fain the Christian faith to know."<br>
                    Answers him Charles: "Still may he heal his soul."<br>

                    Clear shone the sun in a fair even-tide;<br>
                    Those ten men's mules in stall he bade them tie.<br>
                    Also a tent in the orchard raise on high,<br>
                    Those messengers had lodging for the night;<br>
                    Dozen serjeants served after them aright.<br>
                    Darkling they lie till comes the clear daylight.<br>
                    That Emperour does with the morning rise;<br>

                    His uncle holds the stirrup, Guinemere.<br>
                    Then you had seen so many knights to weep,<br>
                    Who all exclaim: "Unlucky lord, indeed!<br>
                    In the King's court these many years you've been,<br>
                    Noble vassal, they say that have you seen.<br>

                    After they say: "Us too, Sire, shall he lead."<br>
                    Then answers Guenes: "Not so, the Lord be pleased!<br>
                    Far better one than many knights should bleed.<br>
                    To France the Douce, my lords, you soon shall speed,<br>

                    Two fingers' width from scabbard bares the blade;<br>

                    Looks in the brief, sees what the King did write:<br>

                    Strikes with his spear, long as the shaft endures,<br>
                    By fifteen blows it is clean broken through<br>
                    Then Durendal he bares, his sabre good<br>

                    The hauberk white, whose mail was close of woof,<br>
                    Down to the groin cuts all his body through<br>
                    To the saddle; with beaten gold 'twas tooled.<br>
                    Upon the horse that sword a moment stood,<br>

                    Dead in the field among thick grass them threw.<br>
                    After he said "Culvert, false step you moved,<br>

                    A Sarrazin was there, of Sarraguce,<br>
                    Of that city one half was his by use,<br>
                    'Twas Climborins, a man was nothing proof;<br>
                    By Guenelun the count an oath he took,<br>
                    And kissed his mouth in amity and truth,<br>
                    Gave him his sword and his carbuncle too.<br>
                    Terra Major, he said, to shame he'ld put,<br>
                    From the Emperour his crown he would remove.<br>
                    He sate his horse, which he called Barbamusche,<br>
                    Never so swift sparrow nor swallow flew,<br>
                    He spurred him well, and down the reins he threw,<br>
                    Going to strike Engelier of Gascune;<br>
                    Nor shield nor sark him any warrant proved,<br>
                    The pagan spear's point did his body wound,<br>
                    He pinned him well, and all the steel sent through,<br>
                    From the hilt flung him dead beneath his foot.<br>
                    After he said: "Good are they to confuse.<br>
                    Pagans, strike on, and so this press set loose!"<br>
                    "God!" say the Franks, "Grief, such a man to lose!"<br>

                    Than whom we'd no more valiant chevalier."<br>
                    Answered that count: "God, let me him avenge!"<br>
                    Spurs of fine gold into his horse drove then,<br>
                    Held Halteclere, with blood its steel was red,<br>
                    By virtue great to strike that pagan went,<br>
                    Brandished his blade, the Sarrazin upset;<br>
                    The Adversaries of God his soul bare thence.<br>
                    Next he has slain the duke Alphaien,<br>
                    And sliced away Escababi his head,<br>
                    And has unhorsed some seven Arabs else;<br>
                    No good for those to go to war again.<br>
                    Then said Rollanz: "My comrade shews anger,<br>
                    So in my sight he makes me prize him well;<br>
                    More dear by Charles for such blows are we held."<br>

                    And Anseis upon the shield he struck,<br>

                    The count Rollanz, back to the field then hieing<br>
                    Holds Durendal, and like a vassal striking<br>
                    Faldrun of Pui has through the middle sliced,<br>
                    With twenty-four of all they rated highest;<br>
                    Was never man, for vengeance shewed such liking.<br>
                    Even as a stag before the hounds goes flying,<br>
                    Before Rollanz the pagans scatter, frightened.<br>
                    Says the Archbishop: "You deal now very wisely!<br>
                    Such valour should he shew that is bred knightly,<br>
                    And beareth arms, and a good charger rideth;<br>
                    In battle should be strong and proud and sprightly;<br>
                    Or otherwise he is not worth a shilling,<br>
                    Should be a monk in one of those old minsters,<br>
                    Where, day, by day, he'ld pray for us poor sinners."<br>
                    Answers Rollant: "Strike on; no quarter give them!"<br>
                    Upon these words Franks are again beginning;<br>
                    Very great loss they suffer then, the Christians.

                    The man who knows, for him there's no prison,<br>
                    In such a fight with keen defence lays on;<br>
                    Wherefore the Franks are fiercer than lions.<br>
                    Marsile you'd seen go as a brave baron,<br>
                    Sitting his horse, the which he calls Gaignon;<br>
                    He spurs it well, going to strike Bevon,<br>
                    That was the lord of Beaune and of Dijon,<br>
                    His shield he breaks, his hauberk has undone,<br>
                    So flings him dead, without condition;<br>
                    Next he hath slain Yvoerie and Ivon,<br>

                    The count Rollanz, being not far him from,<br>
                    To th'pagan says: "Confound thee our Lord God!<br>
                    So wrongfully you've slain my companions,<br>
                    A blow you'll take, ere we apart be gone,<br>

                    He goes to strike him, as a brave baron,<br>
                    And his right hand the count clean slices off;<br>
                    Then takes the head of Jursaleu the blond;<br>
                    That was the son of king Marsilion.<br>
                    Pagans cry out "Assist us now, Mahom!<br>

                    Into this land he's sent us such felons<br>

                    Says each to each: "Nay let us fly!" Upon<br>
                    That word, they're fled, an hundred thousand gone;<br>

                    He's left behind his uncle, the alcaliph<br>

                    These canter forth with arrogance and heat,<br>

                    With no part white, only their teeth except,<br>

                    Charles the great should not have left you so;<br>
                    He's done us wrong, small thanks to him we owe;<br>

                    You'd seen Rollant aswoon there in his seat,<br>
                    And Oliver, who unto death doth bleed,<br>
                    So much he's bled, his eyes are dim and weak;<br>
                    Nor clear enough his vision, far or near,<br>
                    To recognise whatever man he sees;<br>
                    His companion, when each the other meets,<br>
                    Above the helm jewelled with gold he beats,<br>
                    Slicing it down from there to the nose-piece,<br>
                    But not his head; he's touched not brow nor cheek.<br>
                    At such a blow Rollant regards him keen,<br>
                    And asks of him, in gentle tones and sweet:<br>
                    "To do this thing, my comrade, did you mean?<br>
                    This is Rollanz, who ever held you dear;<br>
                    And no mistrust was ever us between."<br>
                    Says Oliver: "Now can I hear you speak;<br>
                    I see you not: may the Lord God you keep!<br>
                    I struck you now: and for your pardon plead."<br>
                    Answers Rollanz: "I am not hurt, indeed;<br>
                    I pardon you, before God's Throne and here."<br>
                    Upon these words, each to the other leans;<br>
                    And in such love you had their parting seen.

                    Nothing he sees; he hears not any sound;<br>
                    Dismounting then, he kneels upon the ground,<br>
                    Proclaims his sins both firmly and aloud,<br>
                    Clasps his two hands, heavenwards holds them out,<br>

                    Begins to mourn in language very sweet:<br>

                    Count Rollant is a noble and brave soldier,<br>
                    Gualter del Hum's a right good chevalier,<br>
                    That Archbishop hath shewn good prowess there;<br>
                    None of them falls behind the other pair;<br>
                    Through the great press, pagans they strike again.<br>
                    Come on afoot a thousand Sarrazens,<br>
                    And on horseback some forty thousand men.<br>
                    But well I know, to approach they never dare;<br>
                    Lances and spears they poise to hurl at them,<br>
                    Arrows, barbs, darts and javelins in the air.<br>
                    With the first flight they've slain our Gualtier;<br>
                    Turpin of Reims has all his shield broken,<br>
                    And cracked his helm; he's wounded in the head,<br>
                    From his hauberk the woven mail they tear,<br>
                    In his body four spear-wounds doth he bear;<br>
                    Beneath him too his charger's fallen dead.<br>
                    Great grief it was, when that Archbishop fell.<br>

                    Turpin of Reims hath felt himself undone,<br>
                    Since that four spears have through his body come;<br>
                    Nimble and bold upon his feet he jumps;<br>
                    Looks for Rollant, and then towards him runs,<br>
                    Saying this word: "I am not overcome.<br>
                    While life remains, no good vassal gives up."<br>
                    He's drawn Almace, whose steel was brown and rough,<br>
                    Through the great press a thousand blows he's struck:<br>
                    As Charles said, quarter he gave to none;<br>
                    He found him there, four hundred else among,<br>
                    Wounded the most, speared through the middle some,<br>
                    Also there were from whom the heads he'd cut:<br>
                    So tells the tale, he that was there says thus,<br>
                    The brave Saint Giles, whom God made marvellous,<br>
                    Who charters wrote for th' Minster at Loum;<br>

                    Great pain he has, and trouble in his head,<br>
                    His temples burst when he the horn sounded;<br>

                    Takes the olifant, and feebly sounds again.<br>
                    That Emperour stood still and listened then:<br>

                    Takes the olifant, that no reproach shall hear,<br>
                    And Durendal in the other hand he wields;<br>
                    Further than might a cross-bow's arrow speed<br>
                    Goes towards Spain into a fallow-field;<br>
                    Climbs on a cliff; where, under two fair trees,<br>
                    Four terraces, of marble wrought, he sees.<br>
                    There he falls down, and lies upon the green;<br>
                    He swoons again, for death is very near.

                    A Sarrazin him all the time espies,<br>
                    Who feigning death among the others hides;<br>
                    Blood hath his face and all his body dyed;<br>
                    He gets afoot, running towards him hies;<br>
                    Fair was he, strong and of a courage high;<br>
                    A mortal hate he's kindled in his pride.<br>
                    He's seized Rollant, and the arms, were at his side,<br>
                    "Charles nephew," he's said, "here conquered lies.<br>
                    To Araby I'll bear this sword as prize."<br>

                    "Thou'rt never one of ours, full well I know."<br>
                    Took the olifant, that he would not let go,<br>
                    Struck him on th' helm, that jewelled was with gold,<br>
                    And broke its steel, his skull and all his bones,<br>
                    Out of his head both the two eyes he drove;<br>
                    Dead at his feet he has the pagan thrown:<br>

                    In all his face the colour is grown white.<br>
                    In front of him a great brown boulder lies;<br>

                    The steel cries out, but does not break outright;<br>
                    And the count says: "Saint Mary, be my guide<br>

                    So when he sees he never can it break,<br>
                    Within himself begins he to complain:<br>

                    In Moriane was Charles, in the vale,<br>

                    For this sword's sake sorrow upon me weighs,<br>
                    Rather I'ld die, than it mid pagans stay.<br>

                    Rollant his stroke on a dark stone repeats,<br>
                    And more of it breaks off than I can speak.<br>
                    The sword cries out, yet breaks not in the least,<br>
                    Back from the blow into the air it leaps.<br>
                    Destroy it can he not; which when he sees,<br>

                    Many broad lands with you have I retrieved<br>
                    Which Charles holds, who hath the great white beard;<br>

                    Beneath a pine running in haste he came,<br>

                    (As he desired) and all the Franks his race;--<br>
                    'Ah, gentle count; conquering he was slain!'--<br>
                    He owned his faults often and every way,<br>
                    And for his sins his glove to God upraised.<br>

                    Holds out his glove towards God, as he speaks<br>
                    Angels descend from heaven on that scene.<br>

                    Turning his eyes towards Spain, he begins<br>
                    Remembering so many divers things:<br>
                    So many lands where he went conquering,<br>
                    And France the Douce, the heroes of his kin,<br>
                    And Charlemagne, his lord who nourished him.<br>
                    Nor can he help but weep and sigh at this.<br>
                    But his own self, he's not forgotten him,<br>
                    He owns his faults, and God's forgiveness bids:<br>
                    "Very Father, in Whom no falsehood is,<br>
                    Saint Lazaron from death Thou didst remit,<br>

                    His right-hand glove, to God he offers it<br>
                    Saint Gabriel from's hand hath taken it.<br>
                    Over his arm his head bows down and slips,<br>

                    The King commands Gebuin and Otun,<br>
                    Tedbalt of Reims, also the count Milun:<br>
                    "Guard me this field, these hills and valleys too,<br>

                    These answer him sweetly, their love to prove:<br>

                    For Charlemagne a great marvel God planned:<br>
                    Making the sun still in his course to stand.<br>
                    So pagans fled, and chased them well the Franks<br>
                    Through the Valley of Shadows, close in hand;<br>
                    Towards Sarraguce by force they chased them back,<br>
                    And as they went with killing blows attacked:<br>
                    Barred their highways and every path they had.<br>
                    The River Sebre before them reared its bank,<br>
                    'Twas very deep, marvellous current ran;<br>
                    No barge thereon nor dromond nor caland.<br>
                    A god of theirs invoked they, Tervagant.<br>
                    And then leaped in, but there no warrant had.<br>
                    The armed men more weighty were for that,<br>
                    Many of them down to the bottom sank,<br>
                    Downstream the rest floated as they might hap;<br>
                    So much water the luckiest of them drank,<br>
                    That all were drowned, with marvellous keen pangs.<br>
                    "An evil day," cry Franks, "ye saw Rollant!"

                    Of battles great and very hot contests;<br>
                    With reason thus I heard Rollant speak then:<br>
                    He would not die in any foreign realm<br>
                    Ere he'd surpassed his peers and all his men.<br>
                    To the foes' land he would have turned his head,<br>

                    The strap of it was a good silken web;)<br>

                    Tears both the sides of his embroidered ha'berk,<br>
                    Through the carcass thrusts all his yellow banner;<br>

                    He's drawn his sword, whose hilt is of crystal,<br>

                    His charger's neck he clasped with both his hands.<br>

                    Charles, hearing how that holy Angel spake,<br>
                    Had fear of death no longer, nor dismay;<br>
                    Remembrance and a fresh vigour he's gained.<br>
                    So the admiral he strikes with France's blade,<br>
                    His helmet breaks, whereon the jewels blaze,<br>
                    Slices his head, to scatter all his brains,<br>
                    And, down unto the white beard, all his face;<br>
                    So he falls dead, recovers not again.<br>
                    "Monjoie," cries Charles, that all may know the tale.<br>
                    Upon that word is come to him Duke Naimes,<br>
                    Holds Tencendur, bids mount that King so Great.<br>
                    Pagans turn back, God wills not they remain.<br>
                    And Franks have all their wish, be that what may.

                    Says the King then: "My Lords, avenge your ills,<br>
                    Unto your hearts' content, do what you will!<br>
                    For tears, this morn, I saw your eyes did spill."<br>
                    Answer the Franks: "Sir, even so we will."<br>
                    Then such great blows, as each may strike, he gives<br>
                    That few escape, of those remain there still.

                    Aloud she cried: "Give us your aid, Mahume!<br>
                    Ah! Noble king, conquered are all our troops,<br>
                    And the admiral to shameful slaughter put!"<br>
                    When Marsile heard, towards the wall he looked,<br>
                    Wept from his eyes, and all his body stooped,<br>
                    So died of grief. With sins he's so corrupt;<br>
                    The soul of him to Hell live devils took.

                    Then his barons, returning to Carlun,<br>
                    Say to their King: "Sire, we beseech of you<br>
                    That you cry quits with county Guenelun,<br>
                    So he may serve you still in love and truth;<br>
                    Nay let him live, so noble a man 's he proved.<br>
                    Rollant is dead, no longer in our view,<br>
                    Nor for no wealth may we his life renew."<br>

                    When Charles saw that all of them did fail,<br>
                    Deep down he bowed his head and all his face<br>
                    For th' grief he had, caitiff himself proclaimed.<br>
                    One of his knights, Tierris, before him came,<br>
                    Gefrei's brother, that Duke of Anjou famed;<br>
                    Lean were his limbs, and lengthy and delicate,<br>
                    Black was his hair and somewhat brown his face;<br>
                    Was not too small, and yet was hardly great;<br>
                    And courteously to the Emperour he spake:<br>
                    "Fair' Lord and King, do not yourself dismay!<br>
                    You know that I have served you many ways:<br>
                    By my ancestors should I this cause maintain.<br>
                    And if Rollant was forfeited to Guenes<br>
                    Still your service to him full warrant gave.<br>
                    Felon is Guene, since th' hour that he betrayed,<br>
                    And, towards you, is perjured and ashamed:<br>
                    Wherefore I judge that he be hanged and slain,<br>
                    His carcass flung to th' dogs beside the way,<br>
                    As a felon who felony did make.<br>
                    But, has he a friend that would dispute my claim<br>
                    With this my sword which I have girt in place<br>
                    My judgement will I warrant every way."<br>
                    Answer the Franks: "Now very well you spake."

                    Go thou by force into the land of Bire,<br>
                    King Vivien thou'lt succour there, at Imphe,<br>
                    In the city which pagans have besieged.<br>
                    The Christians there implore thee and beseech."<br>
                    Right loth to go, that Emperour was he:<br>
                    "God!" said the King: "My life is hard indeed!"<br>
                    Tears filled his eyes, he tore his snowy beard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SO ENDS THE TALE WHICH TUROLD HATH CONCEIVED.
                </p>
