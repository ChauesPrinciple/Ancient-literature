<h2 id="c13">THE SONG OF ROLAND</h2>
<h3 id="laisse_1">1</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_1">Carlon the King, our Emperor Charlemayn,</p>
<p id="line_2">Full seven years long has been abroad in Spain,</p>
<p id="line_3">He’s won the highlands as far as to the main;</p>
<p id="line_4">No castle more can stand before his face,</p>
<p id="line_5">City nor wall is left for him to break,</p>
<p id="line_6">Save Saragossa in its high mountain place;</p>
<p id="line_7">Marsilion holds it, the king who hates God’s name,</p>
<p id="line_8">Mahound he serves, and to <a href="#note_8">Apollyon</a> prays:</p>
<p id="line_9">He’ll not escape the ruin that awaits.</p>
<p><span>AOI</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_2">2</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_10">Marsilion sat in Saragossa town,</p>
<p id="line_11">He sought an orchard where shade was to be found,</p>
<p id="line_12">On a bright dais of marble he lies down;</p>
<p id="line_13">By twenty thousand his vassals stand around.</p>
<p id="line_14">He calls before him all his dukes and his counts:</p>
<p id="line_15">“Listen, my lords, what affliction is ours!</p>
<p id="line_16">The Emperor Charles that wears fair France’s crown</p>
<p id="line_17">Invades our country our fortunes to confound.</p>
<p id="line_18">I have no host but before him gives ground,</p>
<p id="line_19">I find no force his forces for to flout;</p>
<p id="line_20">Wise men of wit, give counsel to me now,</p>
<p id="line_21">Save me from death and loss of my renown.”</p>
<p id="line_22">There’s ne’er a paynim utters a single sound,</p>
<p id="line_23">Till Blancandrin, Valfonda’s lord, speaks out.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_3">3</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_24">Blancandrin’s wise amid the paynim horde; <span>[24-46]</span></p>
<p id="line_25">He was for valour a mighty knight withal,</p>
<p id="line_26">And fit of wit for to counsel his lord.</p>
<p id="line_27">He tells the king; “Be you afeared for naught,</p>
<p id="line_28">But send to Charles in his pride and his wrath</p>
<p id="line_29">Your faithful service and your friendship henceforth.</p>
<p id="line_30">Promise him lions and bears and hounds galore,</p>
<p id="line_31">Sev’n hundred camels and a thousand <a href="#note_31">mewed hawks</a>,</p>
<p id="line_32">Four hundred pack-mules with gold and silver store,</p>
<p id="line_33">And fifty wagons, a wagon-train to form,</p>
<p id="line_34">Whence he may give his <a href="#note_34">soldiers</a> rich rewards.</p>
<p id="line_35">Say, in this land he has made enough war;</p>
<p id="line_36">To <a href="#note_36">Aix</a> in France let him go home once more;</p>
<p id="line_37">At Michaelmas you’ll follow to his court,</p>
<p id="line_38">There you’ll submit unto the Christian law,</p>
<p id="line_39">And be his man by faith and fealty sworn.</p>
<p id="line_40">Hostages too, if for sureties he call,</p>
<p id="line_41">You’ll let him have, ten maybe or a score;</p>
<p id="line_42">’Twere good we send the sons our wives have borne:</p>
<p id="line_43">I’ll send mine own, though he should die therefor.</p>
<p id="line_44">Better by far the heads of them should fall</p>
<p id="line_45">Than we should lose honour, estate and all.</p>
<p id="line_46">And be reduced to beggary and scorn.”</p>
<p><span>AOI</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_4">4</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_47">Quoth Blancandrin: “I swear by my right hand <span>[47-75]</span></p>
<p id="line_48">And beard that flutters about my girdle-span,</p>
<p id="line_49">Straightway you’ll see the Frenchman’s host disband:</p>
<p id="line_50">They’ll hurry home to France, their native land,</p>
<p id="line_51">When each within his favourite haunt is back,</p>
<p id="line_52">Charles in his chapel at Aix will take his stand,</p>
<p id="line_53">And there he’ll hold high feast at Michaelmas.</p>
<p id="line_54">The time will pass, the trysted hour elapse:</p>
<p id="line_55">No news of us, no message will he have.</p>
<p id="line_56">Fierce is the king, a cruel-hearted man;</p>
<p id="line_57">Our sureties’ heads he’ll smite off with the axe.</p>
<p id="line_58">Better their heads should fall into their laps</p>
<p id="line_59">Than that fair Spain should fall from out our hands,</p>
<p id="line_60">And we should suffer grave losses and mishap.”</p>
<p id="line_61">The Paynims say: “There is some truth in that.”</p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_5">5</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_62">The King Marsile had ended the debate;</p>
<p id="line_63">He calls before him Clarin of Balagate,</p>
<p id="line_64">Estramarin, and Eudropin his mate;</p>
<p id="line_65">And Garlon Longbeard and Priamon he names,</p>
<p id="line_66">And Machiner and his uncle Matthay,</p>
<p id="line_67">Johun of Outremer, and Malabayn,</p>
<p id="line_68">And Blancandrin; these ten make up the tale,</p>
<p id="line_69">Ten matchless villains, to whom he’s said his say:</p>
<p id="line_70">“Barons, my lords, get you to Charlemayn,</p>
<p id="line_71">Who sits at siege, Cordova town to take.</p>
<p id="line_72">Bear each in hand an olive-branch displayed;</p>
<p id="line_73">Peace and submission are signified that way.</p>
<p id="line_74">If you contrive this treaty to arrange,</p>
<p id="line_75">Of gold and silver I’ll give you goodly weight,</p>
<p id="line_76">And lands and fiefs as much as heart can crave.” <span>[76-100]</span></p>
<p id="line_77">The Paynims answer: “That will be ample pay.”</p>
<p><span>AOI</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_6">6</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_78">Marsile the king his conference had ceased.</p>
<p id="line_79">He tells his men: “My barons, go with speed;</p>
<p id="line_80">Bear in your hands boughs of the olive tree.</p>
<p id="line_81">On my behalf King Charlemayn beseech,</p>
<p id="line_82">For his God’s sake to show me clemency.</p>
<p id="line_83">Say, this month’s end in truth he shall not see</p>
<p id="line_84">Ere I shall seek him with thousand vassals leal.</p>
<p id="line_85">The law of Christ I’ll then and there receive,</p>
<p id="line_86">In faith and love I will his liegeman be.</p>
<p id="line_87">I’ll send him sureties if thus he shall decree.”</p>
<p id="line_88">Quoth Blancandrin: “Be sure he’ll grant your plea.”</p>
<p><span>AOI</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_7">7</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_89">Marsilion sent for ten mules white as snow,</p>
<p id="line_90">(A gift that erst Suatilia’s king bestowed),</p>
<p id="line_91">Their saddles silver, their bridles all of gold.</p>
<p id="line_92">Now are they mounted, the men who are to go;</p>
<p id="line_93">All in their hands the olive-branches hold.</p>
<p id="line_94">They came to Carlon that hath France in control;</p>
<p id="line_95">They’ll trap him somehow, for it is fated so.</p>
<p><span>AOI</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_8">8</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_96">The Emperor Charles is glad and full of cheer.</p>
<p id="line_97">Cordova’s taken, the outer walls are pierced,</p>
<p id="line_98">His catapults have cast the towers down sheer;</p>
<p id="line_99">Rich booty’s gone to all his chevaliers,</p>
<p id="line_100">Silver and gold and goodly battle-gear.</p>
<p id="line_101">In all the city no paynim now appears <span>[101-29]</span></p>
<p id="line_102">Who is not slain or turned to Christian fear.</p>
<p id="line_103">The Emperor sits in a great orchard near,</p>
<p id="line_104">Having about him Roland and Olivere,</p>
<p id="line_105">Samson the duke, and Anseis the fierce,</p>
<p id="line_106">Geoffrey d’Anjou the King’s gonfalonier,</p>
<p id="line_107">And Gerin too, and with him too Gerier;</p>
<p id="line_108">And where these were was many another <a href="#note_108">fere</a>—</p>
<p id="line_109">Full fifteen thousand of France the fair and dear.</p>
<p id="line_110">Upon white carpets they sit, those noble peers,</p>
<p id="line_111">For draughts and chess the chequer-boards are reared;</p>
<p id="line_112">To entertain the elder lords revered;</p>
<p id="line_113">Young bachelors disport with sword and spear.</p>
<p id="line_114">Beneath a pine beside an <a href="#note_114">eglantier</a></p>
<p id="line_115">A faldstool stands all of the red gold clear;</p>
<p id="line_116">Of fairest France there sits the king austere.</p>
<p id="line_117">White are his locks, and silver is his beard,</p>
<p id="line_118">His body noble, his countenance severe:</p>
<p id="line_119">If any seek him, no need to say, “Lo, here!”</p>
<p id="line_120">From off their steeds lit down the messengers,</p>
<p id="line_121">Well did they greet him with shows of love sincere.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_9">9</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_122">Before them all Blancandrin forward stood;</p>
<p id="line_123">And hailed the King: “God give His grace to you,</p>
<p id="line_124">The glorious God to whom worship is due.</p>
<p id="line_125">Thus speaks the king, Marsilion, great in rule:</p>
<p id="line_126">Much hath he studied the saving faith and true.</p>
<p id="line_127">Now of his wealth he would send you in sooth</p>
<p id="line_128">Lions and bears, leashed greyhounds not a few,</p>
<p id="line_129">Sev’n hundred camels, a thousand falcons mewed,</p>
<p id="line_130">And gold and silver borne on four hundred mules; <span>[130-53]</span></p>
<p id="line_131">A wagon-train of fifty carts to boot,</p>
<p id="line_132">And store enough of golden bezants good</p>
<p id="line_133">Wherewith to pay your soldiers as you should.</p>
<p id="line_134">Too long you’ve stayed in this land to our rue:</p>
<p id="line_135">To Aix in France return you at our suit.</p>
<p id="line_136">Thither my liege will surely follow you,</p>
<p>[And will become your man in faith and truth,</p>
<p>And at your hand hold all his realm in feu!”]</p>
<p id="line_137">With lifted hands to God the Emperor sues;</p>
<p id="line_138">Then bows his head and so begins to brood.</p>
<p><span>AOI</span></p>

<h3 id="laisse_10">10</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_139">The Emperor bode long time with downcast eyes;</p>
<p id="line_140">He was a man not hasty in reply,</p>
<p id="line_141">But wont to speak only when well advised.</p>
<p id="line_142">When he looked up, his glance was stern and high.</p>
<p id="line_143">He told the envoys: “Fair is your speech and fine;</p>
<p id="line_144">Yet King Marsile is foe to me and mine.</p>
<p id="line_145">In all these words and offers you recite</p>
<p id="line_146">I find no warrant wherein I may confide.”</p>
<p id="line_147">“Sureties for this”, the Saracen replies,</p>
<p id="line_148">“Ten or fifteen or twenty we’ll provide.</p>
<p id="line_149">One of my sons I’ll send, on pain to die;</p>
<p id="line_150">Others, yet nobler, you’ll have, as I divine.</p>
<p id="line_151">When in your palace high feast you solemnise</p>
<p id="line_152">To great <a href="#note_152">St Michael of Peril-by-the-Tide</a>,</p>
<p id="line_153">He’ll follow you, on that you may rely,</p>
<p id="line_154">And in those <a href="#note_154">baths</a> God made you by His might <span>[154-70]</span></p>
<p id="line_155">He would turn Christian and there would be baptized.”</p>
<p id="line_156">Quoth Charles: “He yet may save his soul alive.”</p>

<h3 id="laisse_11">11</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_157">Fair was the ev’ning and clearly the sun shone;</p>
<p id="line_158">The ten white mules Charles sends to stall anon;</p>
<p id="line_159">In the great orchard he bids men spread aloft</p>
<p id="line_160">For the ten envoys a tent where they may lodge,</p>
<p id="line_161">With <a href="#note_161">sergeants</a> twelve to wait on all their wants.</p>
<p id="line_162">They pass the night there till the bright day draws on.</p>
<p id="line_163">Early from bed the Emperor now is got;</p>
<p id="line_164">At mass and matins he makes his orison.</p>
<p id="line_165">Beneath a pine straightway the King is gone,</p>
<p id="line_166">And calls his barons to council thereupon;</p>
<p id="line_167">By French advice whate’er he does is done.</p>

<h3 id="laisse_12">12</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_168">The Emperor goes beneath a tall pine-tree,</p>
<p id="line_169">And to his council he calls his barony:</p>
<p id="line_170">There Duke <a href="#note_170">Ogier</a>, Archbishop Turpin meet,</p>
<p id="line_171"><a href="#note_171">Richard the Old</a> and his nephew Henri, <span>[171-95]</span></p>

<p id="line_173">Miles, and his cousin the Lord Tibbald of Rheims,</p>
<p id="line_174">Gerin likewise and Gerier are convened;</p>
<p id="line_175">And County Roland, there with the rest came he,</p>
<p id="line_176">And Oliver, noble and good at need;</p>
<p id="line_177">All French of France, thousand and more, maybe;</p>
<p id="line_178">And Ganelon that wrought the treachery.</p>
<p id="line_179">So starts that council which came to such sore grief.</p>
<p><span>AOI</span></p>

<h3 id="laisse_13">13</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_180">“Barons, my lords”, began the Emperor Carlon,</p>
<p id="line_181">“From King Marsile come envoys, seeking parley.</p>
<p id="line_182">He makes me offers of treasure overpassing:</p>
<p id="line_183">Of lions and bears and hounds to the leash mastered,</p>
<p id="line_184">Sev’n hundred camels, and falcons mewed and hearty,</p>
<p id="line_185">Four hundred mules with Arab gold all chargèd,</p>
<p id="line_186">And fifty wagons well-laden in a cart-train.</p>
<p id="line_187">But now to France he urges my departure,</p>
<p id="line_188">And to my palace at Aix he’ll follow after,</p>
<p id="line_189">There change his faith for one of more advantage,</p>
<p id="line_190">Become a Christian and of me hold his marches.</p>
<p id="line_191">But his true purpose—for that I cannot answer.”</p>
<p id="line_192">The French all say: “We’d best be very guarded.”</p>
<p><span>AOI</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="laisse_14">14</h3>
<div>
<p id="line_193">The Emperor Charles had finished all his speech.</p>
<p id="line_194">The County Roland, who fiercely disagrees,</p>
<p id="line_195">Swift to oppose springs up upon his feet:</p>
<p id="line_196">He tells the King: “Nevermore trust Marsile! <span>[196-225]</span></p>
<p id="line_197">Seven years long in land of Spain we’ve been.</p>
<p id="line_198">I won for you both Noples and Commibles,</p>
<p id="line_199">I took Valterna, the land of Pine I seized,</p>
<p id="line_200">And Balagate, and Seville and Tudele.</p>
<p id="line_201">Then wrought Marsile a very treacherous deed:</p>
<p id="line_202">He sent his Paynims by number of fifteen,</p>
<p id="line_203">All of them bearing boughs of the olive tree,</p>
<p id="line_204">And with like words he sued to you for peace.</p>
<p id="line_205">Then did you ask the French lords for their <a href="#note_205">rede</a>;</p>
<p id="line_206">Foolish advice they gave to you indeed.</p>
<p id="line_207">You sent the Paynim two counts of your meinie:</p>
<p id="line_208">Basan was one, the other was Basile.</p>
<p id="line_209">He smote their heads off in hills beneath Haltile.</p>
<p id="line_210">This war you’ve started wage on, and make no cease;</p>
<p id="line_211">To Saragossa lead your host in the field,</p>
<p id="line_212">Spend all your life, if need be, in the siege,</p>

<div>
<p id="line_214">The Emperor Charles sat still with his head bended;</p>
<p id="line_215">He stroked his beard and his moustaches gently;</p>
<p id="line_216">Nor good nor ill he answers to his nephew.</p>
<p id="line_217">The French are silent, Guènes alone excepted;</p>
<p id="line_218">But he leaps up, strides into Carlon’s presence,</p>
<p id="line_219">And full of pride begins thus to address him.</p>
<p id="line_220">He tells the King: “Trust not a brawling fellow,</p>

<p id="line_222">If King Marsile informs you by this message</p>
<p id="line_223">He’ll set his hands in yours, and fealty pledge you,</p>
<p id="line_224">And hold all Spain from you, at your good pleasure,</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>
<div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a></sup>A page, recently rediscovered, from the Codex Emiliense 39 attests the existence, at or shortly before the date of the <i>Chanson de Roland</i>, of a Roland-legend, analogous to, but independent of, the <i>Chanson</i> (see <i>Revista de Filologia Española</i>, 1953, pp. 1-94).</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a></sup>The ceremonial beard and the exterior marks of great age linger on for a long time in literature as the conventional expression of paternal authority. We do wrong to enter into realistic calculations about the respective ages of Cordelia and Lear, Juliet and Old Capulet; the “aged father”, like the aged king, is a semantic device, which may be used either to inspire reverence, or, in the customary comic reversal of order, to make a mock of reverence.</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a></sup>The situation is made very clear in the <i>Geste</i> called the <i>Chanson de Willame</i>. Here, the cowardly Count Esturmi flees before the battle begins, and his followers, showing an excellent spirit, call on Count Vivian to lead them. Vivian replies that he will gladly do so, but that he sees one great objection:
<div>
<p>“You’re not my vassals, and I am not your lord;</p>
<p>Should you desert me you would not be forsworn.”</p>
</div>
<p>Esturmi’s vassals see the force of this, and at once regularise the position by taking a personal oath to follow him loyally “as long as you shall live”.</p>
</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a></sup>Note that he does not die by any Paynim hand—his person is too sacred—but as a result of his own superhuman exertions.</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a></sup>Compare the structure of Shakespeare’s <i>Julius Caesar</i>, which, in the same way, is the story of a murder, duly and correctly followed by a vengeance.</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_6" href="#fr_6">[6]</a></sup><i>Histoire de la Littérature Française</i> (1894) p. 25.</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a></sup>Looked on thus, as a whole, it has a much greater theme than that of the <i>Iliad</i>. This does not mean that it is a greater poem; it is not, by a long way. In style and technique it is primitive, and has nothing to compare with Homer’s music and accomplishment. But in depicting, as both poems do, a struggle between two civilisations, the Christian poet is much more conscious of a serious purpose, and the mainspring of the action is something more important than the recapture of a wife or a quarrel about booty. In virtue of this greater seriousness and self-awareness, the <i>Song of Roland</i>, though “primitive” in form, is entitled to take rank with “secondary” epic, and to be compared (from this point of view only) with Virgil and Milton rather than Homer. (For the distinction between “primary” and “secondary” epic, see C. S. Lewis: A Preface to <i>Paradise Lost</i>.)</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a></sup>God! how sad is the sound of the horn in the heart of the woods!
<p><span>A. de Vigny</span></p>
</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a></sup>The rite of homage, by the hands and the kiss, is still performed at the Coronation of an English sovereign.</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a></sup>Witnesses were usually chosen as young as possible in order that they might survive the longer to give their testimony in case of subsequent dispute. The place of the buffet was sometimes taken by a small gift of some kind, or, more drastically, by forcible immersion in cold water.</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a></sup>If you unhorsed your opponent without falling yourself, it was sometimes prudent as well as chivalrous to dismount also, lest he should kill or disable your mount. This situation does not occur in the <i>Roland</i>, but in the <i>Geste</i> of the <i>Couronnement de Louis</i>, the hero, Guillaume Court-nez, is particularly praised for his valour in that, when contending on foot against a mounted adversary, he refrains from attacking the horse. To do so would be the obvious way of lessening the odds against him, but he would consider it unknightly behaviour—and besides, he wants the horse himself, having lost his own!</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a></sup>A feminine ending is one in which the stressed syllable which carries the assonance is followed by an unaccented e (Charlës, Francë); a masculine ending is one in which it is not so followed (gant, Rollánt).</div>
<div><sup><a id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a></sup>Sometimes the scribe omits them, probably by an oversight. Sometimes he puts them in the wrong place; I have silently tidied up the latter anomaly.</div>

Many of them were knights-errant, without territorial attachment, who wandered about offering their services to whoever would employ them.</div>
<div><a href="#line_36" id="note_36"><span>L.</span> 36</a> <i>Aix</i>—Aix-la-Chapelle was the imperial city of Charlemagne, who rebuilt its palace and chapel and granted it many special privileges. He was reputed to have been born there and certainly died and was buried there in 814.</div>

Some commentators have seen here a relic of the very ancient popular conception of the priest-emperor, preserved in the legend of Prester John. But there is, I think, nothing in the line which necessarily ascribes <i>sacerdotal</i> status to Charlemagne, however sacred his person and function. What is probably intended is the <i>prayer</i> of absolution, frequently called simply “the Absolution” (as in the Book of Common Prayer) which can be pronounced by, for example, an abbess, or indeed any other lay person.

<h2 id="c14">NOTE ON <a href="#laisse_50">LAISSE 50</a></h2>
<div>
<p>A vostre femme enveierai dous nusches . . .</p>
<p>Il les ad prises, en sa hoese les butet.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This pair of owches on your wife I bestow . . .</p>
<p>He takes the jewels and thrusts them in his poke.</p>
</div>
<p>These lines present certain problems both to the linguist and to the student of period costume.</p>
<p>To begin with, what exactly is a “nusche” (owch)? The dictionary offers (1) collar, (2) bracelet, (3) brooch. The first meaning is unlikely in the context: the reference seems to be to something which goes in pairs. Either “bracelets” or “brooches” would thus fill the bill, but Dr Joan Evans is of the opinion that the word is seldom or never applied to an <i>annular</i> object. It therefore seems probable that Bramimonda’s gift was a pair of <i>brooches</i>, such as would be used for fastening a cloak below the throat.</p>
<p>Having received the jewels, Ganelon proceeds to thrust them into his <i>hoese</i>. The word (from the Germanic <i>hosa</i>) is usually translated “boot”; but since the foot-gear of the period is very ill-adapted for the transport of stiff and bulky pieces of jewellery, this rendering appears to offer practical difficulties.</p>
<p>The alternatives that have been suggested to me are:</p>
<p>(1) <i>hose.</i> This appears attractive; but the usual French equivalent of the English “hose” is “chauce” (the modern “chausse”). Moreover, there does not seem to be any clear evidence that the long hose of the period (the legs tailored separately from cloth cut on the cross, and attached to the waist by points) were provided with pockets. It is true that Vivian in the <i>Chançun de Willame</i> does produce a pennon from his <i>chauces</i>; but this, being soft, could have been tucked in at the top; “owches” would make an unsightly bulge, and would (one feels) be apt to “work down” disconcertingly.</p>
<p>(2) It is conceivable that the scribe may have accidentally written hoese&lt;hosa for huece&lt;hulcia = <i>cloak</i>, since the two words were almost identically pronounced. In that case, if the “nusches” were brooches, Ganelon would simply have thrust them into his cloak <span id="Page_206">[206]</span> by the pins. But philologists are rightly reluctant to postulate scribal errors <i>praeter necessitatem</i>.</p>
<p>(3) What one would naturally expect Ganelon to use for stowing parcels is the <i>pouch</i> in which every gentleman of the period carried his money and other small movables, and which was worn attached to a belt, either above or below his outer garment. It is not easy to find unambiguous examples of the use of <i>hoese</i> in this sense, nor yet of the cognate Italian <i>uosa</i> (deriving likewise from Ger. <i>hosa</i>). I am, however, indebted to Dr Barbara Reynolds for the information that the latter word has a diminutive, <i>usatto</i>, which appears to have meant pouch as well as boot. The context here is happily quite unambiguous. In the thirteenth century <i>Vita di S. Domenico</i>, a boy suffering from hernia is described as having gone about for the space of two years with his innards enclosed in an <i>usatto</i>. Whatever may have been done with owches, dragon’s claws and other such trifles as the heroes of geste and romance from time to time bestowed about their persons, the unfortunate child with the hernia cannot possibly have put his bowels in his boots—or even in his cloak or his hose. Consequently we may reasonably argue that if <i>usatto</i> meant “pouch” then <i>hoese</i> may have had the same meaning, which is the one that best fits the <i>Roland</i> context. Moreover, in a sixteenth century prescription for the cure of jealousy we find the word “heuse” used, in exactly the same way as “minot”, to mean a measure or container:</p>
<div>
<p>“Prenez de soucy plaine heuse</p>
<p>Et de pensées plain un minot”.</p>
</div>
<p>Compare the English use, “a pocket (small sack) of hops”; “a pocket full of rye.” I have accordingly rendered the word “poke” somewhat tentatively, but still trusting that this is a reasonable possibility, and not mere wishful thinking. (It will be noticed that the Eng. <i>poke, pouch</i>, and the Fr. <i>poche, pochette</i>, stand in much the same relation to one another as the group Fr. <i>hoese</i>, It. <i>uosa, usatto</i>.)</p>
