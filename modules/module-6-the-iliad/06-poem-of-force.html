<p>Simone Weil, an established critic, wrote the twenty-four-page essay &quot;The Iliad, or The Poem of Force" in 1939. The essay is about Homer&#39;s epic poem, <i>The Iliad</i>, and it contains reflections on Simone's conclusion regarding the power and relevance of <b>force</b> in human affairs.</p>
<p>Weil introduces the central theme of her essay in the first three sentences:</p>
<p>The true hero, the true subject, the centre of the <i>Iliad</i>, is force. The force employed by man, <b>force that enslaves man</b>, force before which man&#39;s flesh shrinks away. In this work, at all times, the human spirit is shown as modified by its relations with force, as swept away, blinded, by the very force it imagined it could handle, as deformed by the weight of the force it submits to. (my emphasis)</p>
<p><b>Force is as pitiless to the man who possesses it</b>, or thinks he does<b>, as it is to its victims</b>; the latter it crushes, the former it intoxicates. The power of force is that it turns anybody who is subjected to it into a <i>thing</i>. Exercising to the limit turns man into a thing in the most literal sense: <b>it makes a corpse out of them</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Force is the thing that compels both sides to fight, continuously, despite the many opportunities to break free.</li>
<li>It is also what disfigures the "souls" of the conquered as they come under the vicious rule of the conquerors.</li>
<li>No matter the "side" each human being is transmuted into <i>a thing</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A human being's individuality, ideas, hopes, dreams, all such things become meaningless in war. A human becomes a part of a monstrous machine, the most pitiful of which think for a moment that they are themselves masters of force. But it is only for a moment. Weil points out that every character in the <i>Iliad</i> experiences a feeling of triumph, only to have that triumph stripped away sometimes in the next few lines.</p>
<p>For a better understanding of moral injury, please see this video:</p>

<p>However, I would specifically like you to focus on the notion of force and how it creates moral injury in reflection to soldiers and those who suffer a moral injury within our country as well. Here is a video from Elijah Anderson:</p>

<p>Would you please reflect on the conversations in this video? Does the <em>Iliad</em> teach us something about force, tragedy, and rage that we can use to stem the flow of moral injury?</p>
