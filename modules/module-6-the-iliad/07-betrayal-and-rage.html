<p>Daniel Shay's book <em>Achilles in Vietnam</em> specifically used the Iliad as a way of explaining and processing a soldier's path into PTSD (one might also call it a personal path to Hell). Supporting and understanding what soldiers go through, as well as respect and support, is now much more commonplace than when Shay was doing his work, so, in this way, I believe it is easy for most of us to grasp and agree with.</p>
<p>In the introduction to chapter two of this course, I attempt to provide a representation of how and why Greek tragedy, like the <em>Iliad</em>, expresses such a profound lense by which we can understand what we now call PTSD; I also provide a second connection through Elijah Anderson's <em>Code of the Streets</em>. In it, he demonstrates how "inner city" communities experience the same zero-sum honor system (heroic code, anyone? <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/google/241/winking-face_1f609.png" alt="Winking Face" width="18" height="18">) that Achilles experiences when Agamemnon strips his rightful prize, Briseis.</p>
<p><strong>Please reflect on the Code of the Streets and the argument presented therein for this discussion.</strong></p>
<p>How do you see Achilles', the soldiers', and the reflection of <strong>lack of redress</strong> from institutions (being abandoned by those who are meant to provide protection) mirror what is happening in our communities this year?</p>
