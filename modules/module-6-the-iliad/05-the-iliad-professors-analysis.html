<h2>The Iliad Analysis</h2>
<div class="image-placeholder" style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;"><em>[Image Intended: A Bust of Homer]</em></div>
<p>“The Iliad gives an unvarnished portrayal of the human will to power and the psychological damage that warriors sometimes suffer on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>Within the opening lines of the Iliad, we find that Achilles has recently sacked several cities, and after the sack, both he and Agamemnon are each awarded a concubine: Briseis and Chriseis, respectively. Calchas, Chriseis’ father, arrives at the camp and tries to ransom his daughter. Agamemnon brusquely dismisses the priest, who retires to the beach and prays to Apollo for revenge, the result of which is a plague that kills many Greeks. So far, everything proceeds according to a clear and orderly causality and is a model of linear narrative; however, the rest of the text can be puzzling in more than one way, and most of this misunderstanding occurs when we try to understand the Iliad with our cultural assumptions. Let us try to clear that up.</p>
<p>Agamemnon eventually concedes to return his concubine Chriseis to end the plague, but he also demands that the Achaeans provide him with a prize, “so that I am not alone amongst the Achaeans without a prize,” since that would be unseemly for a commander. Achilles is quick to rebuke Agamemnon, but Agamemnon doubles down: he informs Achilles that he will take either his or Odysseus’ prize.  Achilles notes that no one will follow Agamemnon in the future, for the Achaeans only came to Troy to secure honor for him and Menelaus, but now Agamemnon has threatened to take Achilles’ prize, which he has earned through direct deed and is representative of the honors the Achaeans have bestowed upon him. This action at the center of Agamemnon’s betrayal is hard to understand from our cultural point of view, but there are some inroads.</p>
<p>To focus our discussion on the psychology of this situation: when we recall that Chryseis and Briseis are slaves and that Achilles later declares he wishes Briseis had died rather than cause the quarrel that resulted in the death of Patroclus, someone he plainly cares even more deeply about than her, it may seem strange that Achilles reacts so violently to losing a woman he is not attached to emotionally. Patroclus is his special comrade, so this means that Briseis must have some other value. If Briseis is less important than his Myrmidons, why do Achilles nearly kill Agamemnon over her in the opening of the text? The answer to this question highlights the continued relevance of Homeric poetry to understanding some of our issues today and why they can feel so foreign.</p>
<p>While a societal system such as the one the Achaean display here may be foreign to many readers, it is not a thing of the past. There are many alternative societies, or a society (cultures) that exist within a larger society but are clearly defined as a nonmember of the larger society. Marginalized groups, minorities, or subjected cultures are examples. This can result from a variety of causes:</p>
<p>a lack of law enforcement</p>
<p>corrupt or counter-intuitive enforcement</p>
<p>little or no support from society at large</p>
<p>a lack of institutional superstructures to protect individuals</p>
<p>internalized contempt and projection of society at large</p>
<p>general poverty, helplessness, and hopelessness.</p>
<p>In short, the situation giving rise to a zero-sum system, like the one described in The Code of the Streets, requires not just an individual but a community to assume a general or worldview of personal abandonment because of a hostile world.  Its effect is a community-wide sense that there is little respect to be had, and therefore, everyone competes to get what little they can of what little it is available. As soon as one decides to gain respect by being feared, structures emerge, leading to a formation of “the code of the streets”; features of the code include, above all, an obsession with respect. In other words, the code is a form of intimidation designed to produce respect, which in turn serves as an intangible coat of armor. Respect is not, however, simply based on self-preservation but equally on the need to be compensated for a sense of insignificance, powerlessness, and abandonment in the wider world.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is defined as an oppositional model, in which a group is structured by respect, turns its back on mainstream culture, and regains its meaning through this currency of respect. In this honor-based system, negotiations go on at a symbolic level that involves clothing, grooming, gate, demeanor, and facial expressions; it is a form of presentation in which physical objects assert the respect one is owed: “I wear this jacket because I can.” “Dissing” is also a part of the symbolic exchange of respect, but it can quickly translate into violence.</p>
<p>As we can imagine, an insult does not need to be true. All that matters is that the speaker is believable. The code may be centered on the concept of provoking difference; however, as people increasingly feel buffeted by forces beyond their control, the code provides a framework for negotiating respect. In a world governed by respect, violence simply exists and is a matter of everyday life. The code is therefore not the cause of the violence but a method to regulate it. A person's clothing, or armor ala Achilles, is designed to prevent aggression. The goal is to perform an identity that prevents others from challenging your respect. The code is based on physicality and intimidation, and it is ruthless.</p>
<p>In this light, appearance is reality, and there is a interesting counter point to be seen here between Don Quixote and the culture of respect in the process of creating an identity. Respect must also be negotiated in real-time; it is hard to obtain, is defined by the group on a quasi-material basis, can be quickly lost, and is constantly under negotiation. People obsessed with respect often have thin skins, and disses are therefore possible precursors to actual violence, and this is exacerbated by their sense of alienation from society.</p>
<p>The Greek obsession with honor, then, implies a wider feeling of insignificance, helplessness, and poverty. These may seem strange to say about such proud warriors, but please consider that this is a normal human response to such feelings as in an oppositional model. We can see the Homeric tradition that the heroic code is the product of largely environmental factors, noting that modern humans, for the most part, are insulated from nature. The average ancient persons found themselves subject to incomprehensible, harsh, and often hostile forces in nature that they preceded to personify and sacrifice to gods that control those hostile forces to appease that same feeling of insignificance.</p>
<p>Achilles also demonstrates an eloquence in insulting Agamemnon, and this diss is a fundamental part of the symbolism of honor. In other words, it owes its importance in part to the fact that honor is a symbolic economy. On the other hand, Achilles quick to infer that Agamemnon will take Briseis before he loses Chryseis because it is a cultural assumption that both will engage in such activity for the same reason. Agamemnon wrongly infers that Achilles is engaged in a naked power grab. It is also clear why Achille’s motivation for acting is not important, and all that matters is that Achilles delivers an authoritative performance that Agamemnon cannot refute. In the end, Agamemnon could only attempt to nullify the effect of his loss by taking Briseis.</p>
<p>We also see that honor here is very much a zero-sum system, and that Agamemnon only understands losing his honor in terms of Achilles gaining it, in relative, or even absolute, terms. As honor is negotiated in real-time, it is difficult, if not impossible, for Agamemnon to accept the deferral of compensation that Achilles offers him. Please note how the lack of institutional superstructures that could be used to manage their conflict as a third party does not exist either (the gods are too fickle). It is clear that honor is concretely embodied in physical objects, as well, and Briseis is, in effect, similar to a pair of sneakers. Achilles and Agamemnon are engaging in blood sport over who gets to wear them, hence the insistence on calling her a prize. It is also hard to overlook the misogynistic portrayal of Briseis here. Such tension between Achilles and Agamemnon implies the rhetoric and reality of material scarcity. To lose honor is to become vulnerable. It is an outcome even worse than death since honor is the only thing worth living for. For Agamemnon, his entire enterprise for sacking Troy is at stake. For Achilles, however, what is at stake is the meaning of his existence. Following our discussion on Don Quixote, we can add Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, who note that the will to power defines us as human; thus, Homer is probing a very central nerve. In other words, the epic allows us to analyze the basic drives that exist within all of us, which Homeric society simply attempts to regulate, rather than to disguise or to suppress those inclinations.</p>
<p>Status, or honor, in an honor based culture, is the result of a series of competitive exchanges that establishes one's rank by competing until meeting one’s match. To refuse to compete is to lose while status is properly acquired by competitive means, including gift exchange, marriage, and violence. Athletic competition is also viewed as domesticated combat. No status can be acquired by competing with someone beneath you. Conversely, aiming too high is a recipe for death. There is a relentless pressure on the individual to measure his abilities and those of his possible opponents, and such competition requires witnesses because the function is social: the opinions that count are the ones most grudgingly bestowed.</p>
<p>Agamemnon believes he is the best of the Achaeans because he rules the most people.</p>
<p>Achilles believes that he is the best because he is the greatest fighter.</p>
<p>Achilles thus believes he is owed compensation that will acknowledge his true worth, and Agamemnon believes he cannot jeopardize his social standing by giving Achilles what he wants. The situation between Achilles and Agamemnon leads to bitterness and anger, further shortening their fuse. There can be no deferral in the system, both because of the possibility of violence and equally because there are no institutional superstructures in place to offer deferred redress. This lack of a superstructure creates a profound sense that one must take care of oneself.</p>
<p>There can be no deferral because a person’s self-worth is based on the group's perception of who they are. In a similar situation, many would think to simply walk away from being degraded because of our self-image and precisely because our identity is protected from outward hostility. Our identity is not often subjected to real-time public negotiation. A gang member, by contrast, must respond at once because, like Achilles, if he loses respect in the eyes of the group, he is vulnerable. If Achilles or Agamemnon allowed themselves to be dissed without response, there would be instant pressure by the rest of the group to lower his status still further. Therefore, if he loses an encounter, he may feel compelled to seek revenge to restore his honor.</p>
<p>The gang member and the ancient warrior, then, face a double bind: high status invites challenge, and low status is worse; however, as it invites spite, gang members learn the rudiments of the code already on the elementary school playground. Aggression has a social meaning that defines the voices of individuals and structures the group. There is no place for humility or mercy in this system. The code involves self-preservation, and public identity is what matters, so an individual’s sense of self-worth counts for nothing. For this reason, for the gang member, for the soldier, and Achilles, the code is a performative measure: “I am strong, I can take care of myself, and I love to fight, so do not even think about it.”</p>
<p>We can also understand modern combat veterans by reading the Iliad closely. We have already discussed the many connections this text has with PTSD, but it also displays ways of preventing and mitigating PTSD; this includes honoring the enemy, proper grieving for the dead, and communalizing grief and trauma through narratives, such as the Iliad. Dr. Shay overtly expresses that the ancient Greeks are much more effective at dealing with PTSD than the modern day Americans. Part of this is due to the tendency of modern western religion to demonize one's opponent, and the rest is due to the unfortunate fact that war was a way of life for the Greek world, which engendered effective strategies for dealing with psychological trauma as a simple matter of survival.</p>
<p>Dr. Shay also identifies a Homeric scene known as the aristeia, or lone hero dominating the battlefield, and notes that it is the formal narrative structure for berserking. The aristeia tends to follow the same general structure and shows the warrior at their best. It is also used to structure all the major battle sequences in the Iliad; its typical features include:</p>
<p>The aristeia is an example of a personal narrative of the traumatic experience that allows soldiers to communalize their experience.</p>
<p>It emphasizes that individuals matter.</p>
<p>This term (Greek, aristos, "best") refers to the soldier's highest moment of glory in war, when he fights so bravely and single-mindedly as to experience no fear and to appear nearly invincible.</p>
<p>It is an account or excursus which describes this moment of glory, "the preeminent deeds of one particular hero," such as Diomedes (Books 5-6) or Achilles (Books 20-22).</p>
<p>The emotional state of the warrior is a fighting frenzy that borders on madness and may ultimately threaten the hero's own life, tempting him to over-reach himself, even to forget which side he is fighting on, and to fall into moral blindness.</p>
<p>We have drawn connections between the ancient Greek warriors, our modern warriors, and marginalized groups who must turn to violence to regulate their world, and through that connection, Achilles offers us an important lesson.</p>
<p>Achilles raged until there were floods, fires, and God-like battles of rage, but he does not find peace. He avenges Patroclus and vents his rage on Hector by dragging his body behind his chariot, but he does not find peace. They bury Patroclus, but he does not find peace. He is even able to express how much he loved Patroclus and how devastated he was to lose his friend, but he still does not find peace. There is one scene, however, that does bring Achilles peace: Priam, a frail older man, and the king of Troy, covertly visits Achilles in his camp, which is a tremendous risk; Priam finds Achilles, enters, kneels at his feet, and kisses the hands that murdered his son:</p>
<p>Fifty sons I had when the sons of Achaea came,</p>
<p>nineteen born to me from a single mother's womb</p>
<p>and the rest by other women in the palace. Many,</p>
<p>most of them violent Ares cut the knees from under.</p>
<p>But one, one was left me, to guard my walls, my people—</p>
<p>the one you killed the other day, defending his fatherland,</p>
<p>my Hector! It's all for him I've come to the ships now,</p>
<p>to win him back from you-I bring a priceless ransom.</p>
<p>Revere the gods, Achilles! Pity me in my own right,</p>
<p>remember your own father! I deserve more pity…</p>
<p>I have endured what no one on earth has ever done before—</p>
<p>I put to my lips the hands of the man who killed my son."</p>
<p>It is in this moment that Achilles finds peace through the forgiveness of an older man and the realization that Priam felt just as much pain over the death of his son Hector as he did about Patroclus. There is an important lesson here for everyone.</p>
