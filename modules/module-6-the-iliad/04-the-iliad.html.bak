<h3><span id="anchor_Toc328052743">Bk</span><span id="BkI1">I:1-21</span> Invocation and Introduction</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Goddess, sing me the anger, of <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, <a href="IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>’ son, that fatal anger that brought countless sorrows on the <a href="IlindexA.php#Achaeans">Greeks</a>, and sent many valiant souls of warriors down to <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>, leaving their bodies as spoil for dogs and carrion birds: for thus was the will of <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a> brought to fulfilment. Sing of it from the moment when <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, <a href="IlindexA.php#Atreus">Atreus</a>’ son, that king of men, parted in wrath from noble Achilles.</p>
<p>Which of the gods set these two to quarrel? <a href="IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, the son of <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Leto">Leto</a> and Zeus, angered by the king, brought an evil plague on the army, so that the men were dying, for the son of Atreus had dishonoured <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryses">Chryses</a> the priest. He it was who came to the swift <a href="IlindexA.php#Achaeans">Achaean</a> ships, to free his daughter, bringing a wealth of ransom, carrying a golden staff adorned with the ribbons of far-striking Apollo, and called out to the Achaeans, above all to the two leaders of armies, those sons of Atreus: ‘Atreides, and all you bronze-greaved Achaeans, may the gods who live on Olympus grant you to sack <a href="IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>’s city, and sail back home in safety; but take this ransom, and free my darling child; show reverence for Zeus’s son, far-striking Apollo.’</p>

<p>‘Chryses begs Agamemnon for his daughter’ - Crispijn van de Passe (I), 1613</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc328052744"></span> <span id="BkI22">Bk I:22-52 Chryses invokes Apollo</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Then the rest of the Achaeans shouted in agreement, that the priest should be respected, and the fine ransom taken; but this troubled the heart of <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, son of <a href="IlindexA.php#Atreus">Atreus</a>, and he dismissed the priest harshly, and dealt with him sternly: ‘Old man, don’t let me catch you loitering by the hollow ships today, and don’t be back later, lest your staff and the god’s ribbons fail to protect you. Her, I shall not free; old age will claim her first, far from her own country, in <a href="IlindexA.php#Argos">Argos</a>, my home, where she can tend the loom, and share my bed. Away now; don’t provoke me if you’d leave safely.’</p>
<p>So he spoke, and the old man, seized by fear, obeyed. Silently, he walked the shore of the echoing sea; and when he was quite alone, the old man prayed deeply to Lord <a href="IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, the son of bright-haired <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Leto">Leto</a>: ‘Hear me, Silver Bow, protector of <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryse">Chryse</a> and holy <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Cilla">Cilla</a>, high lord of <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tenedos">Tenedos</a>: if ever I built a shrine that pleased you, if ever I burned the fat thighs of a bull or goat for you, grant my wish: <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Smintheus">Smintheus</a>, with your arrows make the Greeks pay for my tears.’</p>
<p>So he prayed, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Down he came, in fury, from the heights of <a href="IlindexOP.php#Olympus">Olympus</a>, with his bow and inlaid quiver at his back. The arrows rattled at his shoulder as the god descended like the night, in anger. He set down by the ships, and fired a shaft, with a fearful twang of his silver bow. First he attacked the mules, and the swift hounds, then loosed his vicious darts at the men; so the dense pyres for the dead burned endlessly.</p>

<p>‘Apollo’ - Hendrick Goltzius, 1588</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI53"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052745">Bk I:53-100 Achilles and Calchas speak</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>For nine days the god’s arrows fell on the army, and on the tenth <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, his heart stirred by the goddess, white-armed <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, called them to the Place of Assembly, she pitying the <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Danaans">Danaans</a>, whose deaths she witnessed. And when they had assembled, and the gathering was complete, swift-footed Achilles rose and spoke: ‘Son of <a href="IlindexA.php#Atreus">Atreus</a>, if war and plague alike are fated to defeat us Greeks, I think we shall be driven to head for home: if, that is, we can indeed escape death. But why not consult some priest, some prophet, some interpreter of dreams, since dreams too come from <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, one who can tell why Phoebus Apollo shows such anger to us, because of some broken vow perhaps, or some missed sacrifice; in hopes the god might accept succulent lambs or unmarked goats, and choose to avert our ruin.’</p>
<p>He sat down again when he had spoken, and <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Calchas">Calchas</a>, son of <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThestorCalchas">Thestor</a>, rose to his feet, he, peerless among augurs, who knew all things past, all things to come, and all things present, who, through the gift of prophecy granted him by Phoebus Apollo, had guided the Greek fleet to <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ilium">Ilium</a>. He, with virtuous intent, spoke to the gathering, saying: ‘Achilles, god-beloved, you ask that I explain far-striking Apollo’s anger. Well, I will, but take thought, and swear to me you’ll be ready to defend me with strength and word; for I believe I’ll anger the man who rules the <a href="IlindexA.php#Argives">Argives</a> in his might, whom all the Achaeans obey. For a king in his anger crushes a lesser man. Even if he swallows anger for a while, he will nurse resentment till he chooses to repay. Consider then, if you can keep me safe.’</p>
<p>Swift-footed Achilles spoke in reply: ‘Courage, and say out what truth you know, for by god-beloved Apollo to whom you pray, whose utterances you grant to the Danaans, none shall lay hand on you beside the hollow ships, no Danaan while I live and see the earth, not even if it’s <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> you mean, who counts himself the best of the Achaeans.’</p>
<p>Then the peerless seer took heart, and spoke to them, saying: ‘Not for a broken vow, or a missed sacrifice, does he blame us, but because of that priest whom Agamemnon offended, refusing the ransom, refusing to free his daughter. That is why the god, the far-striker, makes us suffer, and will do so, and will not rid the Danaans of loathsome plague, until we return the bright-eyed girl to her father, without his recompense or ransom, and send a sacred offering to <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryse">Chryse</a>; then we might persuade him to relent.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI101"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052746">Bk I:101-147 The argument begins</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>When he had finished speaking, <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Calchas">Calchas</a> sat down, and <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, the warrior, royal son of <a href="IlindexA.php#Atreus">Atreus</a>, leapt up in anger; his mind was filled with blind rage, and his eyes blazed like fire. First he rounded on Calchas, with a threatening look: ‘Baneful prophet, your utterance has never yet favoured me; you only ever love to augur evil, never a word of good is spoken or fulfilled! And now you prophesy to the <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Danaans">Danaan</a> assembly, claiming the far-striker troubles them because I refused fine ransom for a girl, <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryses">Chryses</a>’ daughter, and would rather take her home. Well I prefer her to my wife, <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Clytaemnestra">Clytaemnestra</a>, since she’s no less than her in form or stature, mind or skill. Yet, even so, I’d look to give her up, if that seems best; I’d rather you were safe, and free of plague. So ready a prize at once, for me, I’ll not be the only one with empty hands: that would be wrong: you see for yourselves, my prize now goes elsewhere.’</p>
<p>Then swift-footed Lord <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a> spoke in answer: ‘Great son of Atreus, covetous as ever, how can the brave <a href="IlindexA.php#Achaeans">Achaeans</a> grant a prize? What wealth is there in common, now we have shared our plunder from the cities which cannot be reclaimed? Give up the girl, as the god demands, and we Achaeans will compensate you, three or four times over, if <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a> ever lets us sack high-walled <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Trojans">Troy</a>.’</p>
<p>Then Lord Agamemnon answered him: ‘Brave you may be, godlike Achilles, but don’t try to trick me with your cleverness. You’ll not outwit me or cajole me. Do you think, since you demand I return her, that I’ll sit here without a prize while you keep yours? Let the great-hearted Achaeans find a prize, one that’s to my taste, so the exchange is equal. If not, then I myself will take yours, or seize and keep that of <a href="IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a> or <a href="IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>. Whoever it is, he’ll be angered. But we can ponder all of that later; for now, let us launch a black ship on the shining sea, crew her, and embark creatures for sacrifice and this fair-faced daughter of Chryses too. One of our counsellors can go as captain, Ajax, <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Idomeneus">Idomeneus</a>, noble Odysseus or you, son of <a href="IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, you the most redoubtable of men, and make sacrifice and appease far-striking <a href="IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI148"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052747">Bk I:148-187 Agamemnon and Achilles quarrel</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Then, with an angry look, swift-footed <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a> replied: Why, you shameless schemer, why should any <a href="IlindexA.php#Achaeans">Achaean</a> leap to obey your orders to march or wage war? No quarrel with <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Trojans">Trojan</a> spearmen brought me here to fight: they have done me no wrong. No horse or cow of mine have they stolen, nor have my crops been ravaged in deep-soiled <a href="IlindexOP.php#Phthie">Phthia</a>, nurturer of men, since the shadowy mountains and the echoing sea lie between us. No, for your pleasure, you shameless cur, we followed to try and win recompense, for you and <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menelaus">Menelaus</a>, from the Trojans. And you neither see nor care; and even threaten to rob me of my prize, given by the sons of Achaea, reward for which I laboured. When the Achaeans sack some rich Trojan city, it’s not I who win the prize. My hands bear the brunt of the fiercest fight, but when the wealth is shared, yours is the greater, while I return, weary with battle, to the ships, with some small fraction for my own. So now I’m for Phthia, since it’s better to lead my beaked ships home than stay here dishonoured piling up wealth and goods for you.’</p>
<p>Agamemnon, king of men, answered him then: ‘Be off, if your heart demands it; I’ll not beg your presence on my account. Others, who’ll honour me, are with me: <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, above all, the lord of counsel. Of all the god-beloved princes here you are most odious to me, since war, contention, strife are dear to you. If you are the greatest warrior, well, it was some god I think who granted it. Go home, with your ships and men, and lord it over the <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>: I care naught for you, or your anger. And here’s my threat: since Phoebus <a href="IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a> robs me of <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryses">Chryses</a>’ daughter, a ship and crew of mine will return her, but I’ll pay your quarters a visit myself, and take that prize of yours, fair-faced <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Briseis">Briseis</a>, so that you know how my power exceeds yours, and so that others will think twice before claiming they’re my peers, and comparing themselves to me, face to face.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI188"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052748">Bk I:188-222 Athene counsels Achilles</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>While <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> spoke, the son of <a href="IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a> was gnawed by pain, and the heart in his shaggy breast was torn; whether to draw the sharp blade at his side, scatter the crowd, and kill the son of <a href="IlindexA.php#Atreus">Atreus</a>, or curb his wrath and restrain his spirit. As he pondered this in his mind, his great sword half-unsheathed, <a href="IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a> descended from the sky, sent by <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, the white-armed goddess, who loved and cared for both the lords alike. Athene, standing behind the son of Peleus, tugged at his golden hair, so that only he could see her, no one else. <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, turning in surprise, knew Pallas Athene at once, so terrible were her flashing eyes. He spoke out, with winged words, saying: ‘Why are you here, daughter of aegis-bearing <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>? Is it to witness Agamemnon’s arrogance? I tell you and believe that this son of Atreus’ will pay soon with his life for his insolent acts.’</p>
<p>The goddess, bright-eyed Athene, replied: ‘I came from the heavens to quell your anger, if you’ll but listen: I was sent by the goddess, white-armed Hera, who in her heart loves and cares for you both alike. Come, end this quarrel, and sheathe your sword. Taunt him with words of prophecy; for I say, and it shall come to pass, that three times as many glorious gifts shall be yours one day for this insult. Restrain yourself, now, and obey.’</p>
<p>Then swift-footed Achilles, in answer, said: ‘Goddess, a man must attend to your word, no matter how great his heart’s anger: that is right. Whoever obeys the gods will gain their hearing.’</p>
<p>So saying he checked his great hand on the silver hilt, and thrust the long sword back into its sheath, obeying the word of Athene; she meanwhile had left for <a href="IlindexOP.php#Olympus">Olympus</a>, for the palace of aegis-bearing Zeus, and rejoined the other gods.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI223"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052749">Bk I:223-284 Nestor speaks</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>But, angered still, the son of <a href="IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, once more turned on <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Atreides</a> with bitter taunts: ‘You drunkard with a cur’s mask and the courage of a doe, you’ve never dare to take up arms and fight beside your men, or join the Achaean leaders in an ambush. You’d sooner die. You’d rather steal the prize from any <a href="IlindexA.php#Achaeans">Achaean</a> in this great army who contradicts you. Devourer of your own people you are, because they are weak, or else you, Atreides would have perpetrated your last outrage. But I say true, and swear a solemn oath See this staff, that will never leaf or sprout again now it is severed from its mountain branch, doomed never to be green again, stripped by the bronze adze of its foliage and bark, now borne in their hands by the Achaean judges who defend the laws of <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>: I swear, on this, a solemn oath to you, that a day will surely come when the Achaeans, one and all, shall long for Achilles, a day when you, despite your grief, are powerless to help them, as they fall in swathes at the hands of man-killing <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>. Then you will feel a gnawing pang of remorse for failing to honour the best of the Achaeans.’</p>
<p></p>

<p>‘Dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon’ - Workshop of Bernard Picart, 1710</p>
<p></p>
<p>So spoke the son of Peleus, flung down the gold-studded staff, and resumed his seat; while, opposite, Atreides raged at him. But then soft-spoken <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a> rose, the clear-voiced orator of <a href="IlindexOP.php#Pylos">Pylos</a>, from whose tongue speech sweeter than honey flowed. He had already seen the passing of two mortal generations born and reared with him in holy Pylos, and now he ruled the third. He spoke to the assembly, then, with benevolent intent: ‘Well, here is grief indeed to plague Achaea. How <a href="IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a> and his sons would rejoice, and the hearts of the Trojan throng be gladdened, if they could hear this tale of strife between you two, the greatest of <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Danaans">Danaans</a> in war and judgement. You are both younger than I, so listen, for I have fought beside warriors, better men than you, who ever showed me respect. I have never seen the like of them since, men such as <a href="IlindexOP.php#Peirithous">Peirithous</a>, and <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#DryasLapith">Dryas</a>, the people’s Shepherd, <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Caeneus">Caeneus</a>, <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Exadius">Exadius</a>, godlike <a href="IlindexOP.php#Polyphemus">Polyphemus</a>, and <a href="IlindexA.php#Aegeus">Aegeus</a>’ son <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Theseus">Theseus</a>, one of the immortals. They were the mightiest of earth-born men; the mightiest and struggled with the mightiest, the <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Centaur">Centaurs</a> that lair among the mountains, whom they utterly destroyed. They summoned me, and I joined them, travelling far from Pylos. I held my own among them, though against them no man on earth could fight. Yet they listened to my words, and followed my advice. You too should do the same, for that is wise. Great as you may be, Atreides, do not seek to rob him of the girl, leave him the prize that the Achaeans granted; and you <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, son of Peleus, do not oppose the king blow for blow, since the kingly sceptre brings no little honour to those whom Zeus crowns with glory. You have your power, a goddess for a mother, yet he is greater, ruling over more. Agamemnon, quench your anger, relent towards Achilles, our mighty shield against war’s evils.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI285"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052750">Bk I:285-317 Nestor’s advice ignored</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>‘Old man, indeed you have spoken wisely’, replied <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>. But this man wants to rule over others; to lord it, be king of all, and issue orders, though I know one who will flout him. What though the immortal gods made him a spearman; does that give him the right to utter such insults?’</p>
<p><a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a> then interrupted, saying: ‘A coward, and worthless, I’d be called, if I gave way every time to you no matter what you say. Command the rest if you wish, but give me no orders, I’ll no longer obey. And here’s another thing for you to think on: I’ll not raise a hand to fight for the girl, with you or any other, since you only take back what you gave. But you’ll take nothing else of mine by the swift black ships, against my will. Come, try, and let these men be witness: your blood will flow dark along my spear.’</p>
<p>When their war of words was over, they both rose, and so ended the gathering by the Achaean ships. Achilles left for his fine fleet and his huts, with <a href="IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, son of <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menoetius">Menoetius</a>, and his men; while Agamemnon launched a swift ship in the waves, chose twenty oarsmen, and embarked an offering for the god, then sent the fair-faced daughter of <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryses">Chryses</a> aboard, with Odysseus, that man of resource, to take command.</p>
<p>While they embarked and set sail on the paths of the sea, Atreides ordered his men to purify themselves, and wash the dirt from their bodies in salt-water, and offer <a href="IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a> a sacrifice of unblemished bulls and goats, by the restless waves; and the savour went up to heaven with trails of smoke.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI318"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052751">Bk I:318-356 Agamemnon seizes Briseis</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Though the camp was busy with all this, <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> did not forget his quarrel with Achilles, or his threats, and he summoned his heralds and trusty attendants, <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Talthybius">Talthybius</a> and <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#EurybatesAgamemnon">Eurybates</a>, saying: ‘Go to <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>’ hut, seize the fair-faced <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Briseis">Briseis</a> and bring her here. If he refuses to release her, I’ll go in force to fetch her, and so much the worse for him.’</p>
<p>With this stern command, he sent them on their way, and unwillingly the two made their way along the shore of the restless sea, till they came to the ships and huts of the <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>. They found Achilles seated by his black ship, by his hut, and it gave him no pleasure to see them. Seized by fear and awe of the king, they stood silently; but he in his heart knew their unspoken request, and said: ‘Welcome, heralds, you ambassadors of <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a> and men, approach me. You bear no guilt, only Agamemnon, who sends you here for Briseis. Come, <a href="IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, divinely born, bring out the girl, and hand her to these men. If ever there is need of me to save the Greeks from disaster, let them bear witness to this before the blessed gods, mortal men and that shameless king. His mind raves destructively, indeed, and he fails to look behind him or foresee what might save his Achaeans in the coming fight beside the ships.’</p>
<p>At this, Patroclus obeyed his order, and leading fair-faced Briseis from the hut, handed her to the heralds, who returned beside the line of Achaean ships, with the unwilling girl. But Achilles withdrew from his men, weeping, and sat by the shore of the grey sea, gazing at the shadowy deep; and stretching out his arms, passionately, prayed to his dear <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">mother</a>: ‘Since you bore me to but a brief span of life, Mother, surely Olympian Zeus the Thunderer ought to grant me honour; but he grants me none at all. I am disgraced indeed, by that son of Atreus, imperious Agamemnon, who in his arrogance has seized and holds my prize.’</p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc328052752">Bk</span><span id="BkI357">I:357-427</span> Achilles complains to Thetis, his mother</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Tearfully, he spoke, and his lady mother heard him, in the sea’s depths, where she sat beside her aged father. Cloaked in mist she rose swiftly from the grey brine, and sitting by her weeping son caressed him with her hand, and spoke to him calling him by name: ‘Child, why these tears? What pain grieves your heart? Don’t hide your thoughts; speak, so I may share them.’</p>

<p>‘Thetis’ - Hendrick Goltzius, 1588</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then swift-footed <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a> sighed heavily and spoke: ‘You must know; why need I tell the tale to you who know all? We sacked <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThebesMysia">Thebe</a>, <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#EetionAndromache">Eetion</a>’s sacred city, and brought back all the spoils, which the Achaeans shared out fairly between them, choosing the fair-faced daughter of <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryses">Chryses</a> for Agamemnon. Then Chryses, the priest of far-striking <a href="IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, came to the swift ships of the bronze-clad Greeks to free his daughter with a rich ransom, bearing far-striking Apollo’s ribbons on a golden staff, and begged her freedom of the Achaeans, chiefly the Atreidae, leaders of armies. The Greeks called out their wish, to respect the priest and accept the fine ransom, but this displeased <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> who sent him packing, and with a stern warning. So, angrily, the old man returned, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer, and fired arrows of evil at the Argives. Then men died thick and fast and the god’s darts rained down on the broad camp. At last a seer with knowledge uttered the archer god’s true oracle. I was the first to urge them, there and then, to propitiate the god, but anger gripped that son of Atreus, swiftly he rose and threatened what now has come to pass. Bright-eyed Achaeans in a fast ship are bearing the girl to Chryse with offerings for the god; while heralds have taken from my hut another girl, <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Briseis">Briseis</a>, my prize from the army, and led her away. If you have power, come now, to your son’s aid; ask help from Zeus on Olympus, if ever you warmed his heart by word or deed. Often I heard you, in my <a href="IlindexOP.php#Peleus">father</a>’s halls, claim proudly that you alone of the immortals saved <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, son of <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Cronos">Cronos</a>, lord of the storm, from a vile fate when those other Olympians, <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, <a href="IlindexOP.php#Poseidon">Poseidon</a>, and Pallas <a href="IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>, planned to bind him fast. Goddess, you swiftly summoned, to high <a href="IlindexOP.php#Olympus">Olympus</a>, the hundred-handed monster whom gods call <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Briareus">Briareus</a>, and men <a href="IlindexA.php#Aegaeon">Aegaeon</a>, mightier than his father Poseidon; and you saved Zeus from those bonds. For Briareus seated himself, in his strength, beside that son of Cronos, and the sacred gods in fear left Zeus alone. Kneel beside Zeus, and clasp his knees, remind him of that, in hope he might now choose to help the Trojans, pin down the Achaeans among their ships, slaughter them on the shore, so they may reap their king’s reward, and imperious Agamemnon may realise his blindness (<em><a href="IlindexA.php#Ate">ate</a></em>) in dishonouring the best of the Greeks.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI428"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052753">Bk I:428-487 Chryses’ daughter is returned</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>‘Oh, my son,’ <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a> sadly replied, ‘is it for this I bore you, unlucky in my labour? Since your life is doomed to be brief, filling so short a span, if only it were your fate to stay by the ships, free of pain and sorrow; but you, more wretched than other men, must meet an early death; such is the painful destiny for which I brought you into this world. Yet I’ll go myself to snowy <a href="IlindexOP.php#Olympus">Olympus</a>, and tell the Thunder-bearer <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a> what you have said, hoping that he will hear me. Sit by your swift sea-going boats, meanwhile, nurse your anger against the Achaeans, hold back from the fight; for Zeus has left for <a href="IlindexOP.php#Ocean">Ocean</a>’s stream, to banquet with the peerless <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Ethiopia">Ethiopians</a>, and all the gods go with him; but twelve days hence he returns to Olympus, and then I’ll cross the bronze threshold of his palace, kneel at his feet, and I think persuade him.’ With this, she left him to his anger, caused by their seizing of that lovely girl, against his will.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a> had touched at <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryse">Chryse</a>, bearing the sacrifice. Entering the deep harbour, they furled the sail and stowed it in the black ship, dropped the mast by lowering the forestays, and rowed her to her berth. Then they cast out the anchor stones, made fast the hawsers, and leapt on shore. Next, the offering of cattle for far-striking <a href="IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a> was disembarked, and Chryses’ daughter landed from the sea-going boat. It was Odysseus, that man of resource, who led her to the altar, and handed her to her dear father, saying: ‘<a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Chryses">Chryses</a>, our leader <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> commanded me to return your daughter, and make holy sacrifice to Phoebus for all the Greeks, and propitiate your lord Apollo, who has brought the Argives pain and mourning.’ With this, he handed her to her father who joyfully clasped her in his arms.</p>
<p>Swiftly now they tethered the offering of cattle around the well-built altar, rinsed their hands and took handfuls of sacrificial barley grains. Then Chryses raised his arms and prayed on their behalf: ‘Hear me, God of the Silver Bow, protector of Chryse and holy <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Cilla">Cilla</a>, lord of <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tenedos">Tenedos</a>. Just as once before when I prayed to you, you honoured me and struck the Achaeans a fierce blow, so grant my new plea, and avert this dreadful scourge from the Danaans.’ So he prayed, and Apollo listened.</p>
<p>When they had offered their petition and scattered grains of barley, they drew back the victims’ heads, slit their throats and flayed them. Then they cut slices from the thighs, wrapped them in layers of fat, and laid raw meat on top. These the old man burnt on the fire, sprinkling over them a libation of red wine, while the young men stood by, five-pronged forks in their hands. When the thighs were burnt and they had tasted the inner meat, they carved the rest in small pieces, skewered and roasted them through, then drew them from the spits. Their work done and the meal prepared, they feasted and enjoyed the shared banquet, and when they had quenched their first hunger and thirst, the young men filled the mixing-bowls to the brim with wine and pouring a few drops first into each cup as a libation served the gathering. All that day the Achaeans made music to appease the god, singing the lovely paean, praising the god who strikes from afar; while he listened with delight.</p>
<p>And at sunset as darkness fell, they lay down to sleep by the ships’ cables, and when rosy-fingered <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Eos">Dawn</a> appeared they sailed for the distant camp of the Achaeans. Then far-striking Apollo sent them a following wind, and they raised the mast and spread the white sail. The canvas bellied in the wind and the dark wave hissed at the stern, as the boat gathered way and sped through the flood, forging on its course. So they came to the broad camp of the Achaeans, dragged the black vessel high on shore, and propped her with lengths of timber, then dispersed among the huts and ships.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI488"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052754">Bk I:488-530 Thetis pleads with Zeus</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>But swift-footed <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, heaven-born son of <a href="IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, still nursed his anger beside the swift ships. He avoided the Assembly where men win renown, and kept from battle, eating his heart out where he was, longing for the noise of battle.</p>
<p>At dawn on the twelfth day, the company of immortal gods, led by <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, returned to <a href="IlindexOP.php#Olympus">Olympus</a>. <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a> had not forgotten her promise to her son, and at morning, emerging from the waves, she rose to the broad sky and Olympus. There she found Zeus, he of the far-thundering voice, sitting apart on the highest peak of ridged Olympus. She sank in front of him, clasped his knees with her left arm, raised her right hand to touch his chin, and so petitioned the son of <a href="IlindexBCDE.php#Cronos">Cronos</a>: ‘Father Zeus, if ever I helped you by word or deed, grant me this wish, honour my son, who is doomed to die young. For <a href="IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> the king shows disrespect, arrogantly seizing his rightful prize. Avenge my son, Olympian Zeus, lord of justice; enhance the Trojans’ power, till the Greeks honour and respect my son and make amends.’</p>
<p>Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, made no reply to her words, he sat there silently. But Thetis, still clasping his knees, clung to him and pleaded again: ‘Make me this promise faithfully, and nod your head, or else refuse, for I am powerless, then I shall know how little I am honoured here.’</p>
<p>Zeus, the cloud-lord, deeply troubled, said: ‘This is a sorry business, indeed, and you will force a quarrel with <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>. She will taunt and rile me. As it is, she scolds me endlessly before the other gods, claiming I aid the Trojans in battle. Go now, before she notices, while I think the matter through. Come, I will nod my head, to reassure you, since you immortals know this as my sure pledge; once I give the nod, my word can never be recalled, it proves true and is fulfilled.’</p>
<p>So spoke the son of Cronos, inclining his shadowed brow till the ambrosial locks, on the King’s immortal head, stirred together, and high Olympus shook.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI531"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052755">Bk I:531-567 Hera opposes Zeus</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>So ended their meeting, and <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a> plunged from gleaming Olympus to the briny deep, while <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a> left for his palace. There the company of gods rose to their feet in deference to their father; none daring to stay seated at his entry, all standing as one. He took his royal place, but <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, watching, could not fail to know that silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the Old Man of the Sea, had pleaded with him. At once she goaded Zeus, Cronos’ son: ‘What immortal has sought your counsel, arch-deceiver? It’s ever your delight to work behind my back, and make all your decisions in secret. When did you ever openly discuss your plans with me?’</p>
<p></p>
<p><span data-featherlight="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/pics/Greek/full/interior_homer_iliadbkI531to567.jpg"><img alt="Hera" width="467" height="600" src="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/pics/Greek/interior_homer_iliadbkI531to567.jpg"></span></p>
<p>‘Hera’ - Hendrick Goltzius, 1588</p>
<p></p>
<p>‘Hera’ replied the father of men and gods, ‘do not expect to know all my thoughts: though you are my wife you would find it a burden. Whatever it is right for you to hear, no immortal, no human, shall know before you; but of what I plan without reference to the gods, make no question, do not ask.’</p>
<p>‘Dread son of Cronos,’ the ox-eyed queen replied, ‘what is this? I have never questioned you, nor asked: you have ever peace to think on what you wish. But now my heart fears silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the Old Man of the Sea, has swayed you; for she knelt by you at dawn and clasped your knees. Dare I imagine that you bowed to her, gave her a firm pledge of support for <a href="IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, and promised slaughter by the Greek ships?’</p>
<p>Then cloud-gathering Zeus replied: ‘You’re obsessed, forever brooding. I can hide nothing from you, yet you’ll achieve nothing too, only estrange us, and so much the worse for you. If things are as you think, then is it not because I wish them so? Now sit there, quiet, and obey me; lest I set my all-powerful hands on you, and all the gods of Olympus lack the strength save you.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkI568"></span> <span id="anchor_Toc328052756">Bk I:568-611 Hephaestus calms his mother Hera</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>At this, the ox-eyed queen trembled, restrained herself and sat down silently. All the immortal gods there were troubled, and it was <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>, famed for his skill, who broke the silence, hoping to calm his mother, white-armed <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>: ‘This is a sorry business. It’s intolerable you two should quarrel over a mortal, and set the gods at odd with one another. What joy in a good banquet if animosity prevails? I advise my mother, who herself knows this is best, to make peace with our dear father, <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, lest he reprimand her again and our feast be ruined. What if the Olympian lord of lightening, mightiest of us all by far, should choose to blast us where we sit! Mother, speak gentle words to him, and the Olympian will once more show us grace.’</p>
<p>So saying, he hurried to his dear mother, and placed a two-handled cup in her hands: Be patient, mother, and contain your anger, lest you who are dear to me are beaten while I look on. For all my pain, there’s no way I could help you, the Olympian is a tough antagonist to face. Once before, when I rushed to save you, he seized me by the foot and hurled me from heaven’s threshold; all day headlong I plunged, and fell, with the sun, half-dead, to <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lemnos">Lemnos</a>’ shore. There the <a href="IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sintian">Sintians</a> ran to nurse me from my fall.’</p>
<p>The white-armed goddess, Hera, smiled at this, and took the cup from her son, still smiling. Then he served wine to all the other gods, starting on the left, pouring sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl. And immortal laughter rose from the bliss-filled gods, as they watched Hephaestus bustling about the hall.</p>
<p>So they banqueted all day till sunset, missing nothing of the shared feast, nor of the lovely lyre <a href="IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a> played, nor of the singing <a href="IlindexFGHILMN.php#Muse">Muses</a>, who answered each other in sweet harmony.</p>
<p>But when the sun’s bright light had faded, each went off to rest in their separate houses, built with rare skill by the god lamed in both feet, famous Hephaestus; and Olympian Zeus, the lord of lightning, ascended to his accustomed bed to find sweet sleep, with Hera of the golden throne beside him.</p>
<h2>Book V</h2>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244899">Bk</span><span id="BkV1">V:1-</span>83 Diomedes leads the assault</h3>
<p>Now Pallas&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;gave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tydeus">Tydeus</a>’ son, strength and courage to prove himself the finest of the Argives and win glory and renown. She made his helm and shield burn with unwavering flame, like that of Sirius the star of harvest, who when he has bathed in the Ocean depths rises to shine brightest of all. Such was the fire that streamed from his head and shoulders, as she thrust him into the heart of the fight where the enemy were strongest.</p>
<p>Now, there was a rich and peerless Trojan named&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dares">Dares</a>, priest of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>, who had two sons&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phegeus">Phegeus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#IdaeusTrojan">Idaeus</a>, trained in all manner of warfare. These two detached themselves from the ranks and advanced in their chariot to meet Diomedes, while he charged forward on foot. When they were within range, Phegeus first let fly his long-shadowed spear, whose point flew over Tydeus’ shoulder without touching him. Tydeus replied, and the bronze-tipped shaft sped from his hand, striking his enemy in the chest, and knocking him from the chariot. Idaeus leapt backwards out from the rear, not daring to defend his brother’s corpse. He indeed escaped black fate only because Hephaestus shielded him, spiriting him away cloaked in darkness, so his aged priestly father might not be destroyed by grief. But bold Diomedes freed the horses, and had his comrades drive them off to the hollow ships.</p>
<p>The hearts of the brave Trojans sank seeing one son of Dares dead and the other fleeing, while bright-eyed Athene grasped&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ares">Ares</a>’ hand crying: ‘Ares, bane of the living, blood-drenched sacker of cities, should we not let the Greeks and Trojans fight it out, so father Zeus can grant victory to whichever side he chooses? Let us two leave the field, not risk his wrath.’</p>
<p>So saying she drew him away from the battle, and sat him down on the sand beside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Scamander">Scamander</a>, while the Greeks pushed back the Trojan line. Each of their leaders killed his man. First&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, king of men, toppled the great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OdiusHalizones">Odius</a>, leader of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Halizones">Halizones</a>, from his chariot as he wheeled to flee, striking him with his spear between the shoulders, and out through the chest, so he fell with a thud and a crash of armour.</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Idomeneus">Idomeneus</a>&nbsp;killed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PhaestusMaeonian">Phaestus</a>, the son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Maeonia">Maeonian</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#BorusPhaestus">Borus</a>, from fertile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tarne">Tarne</a>. The famous spearman transfixed his shoulder, as he mounted his chariot, with a thrust of the long spear, and hateful darkness took him. Idomeneus’ men stripped him of his armour.</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menelaus">Menelaus</a>&nbsp;with his sharp spear slew&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScamandriusStrophius">Scamandrius</a>, the skilful hunter, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Strophius">Strophius</a>. He was a master of the chase, taught by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Artemis">Artemis</a>&nbsp;herself to kill all the wild creatures of the mountain forest. Yet Artemis, Mistress of the Bow, was no help now, nor all his former skill in archery. For Menelaus, the great spearman, lanced him in the back as he fled, and drove the point between his shoulders, through the chest. Scamandrius fell face downwards with a crash.</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Meriones">Meriones</a>&nbsp;killed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phereclus">Phereclus</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tecton">Tecton</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Harmon">Harmon</a>’s son, who was skilled in fashioning every kind of clever work, loved greatly as he was by Pallas Athene. He built for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a>&nbsp;those fine ships that proved a source of evil, and a bane to all the Trojans and himself, being ignorant of the gods’ intentions. Meriones chased him down, and when he caught him speared him through the right buttock, beneath the bone and into the bladder, so that he slumped to his knees with a groan, and death enveloped him.</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Meges">Meges</a>&nbsp;killed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pedaeus">Pedaeus</a>, a bastard son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Antenor">Antenor</a>’s, whom Lady&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Theano">Theano</a>&nbsp;had raised with care as if he were her own, to please her husband. Meges the mighty spearman,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phyleus">Phyleus</a>’ son, caught him and struck him in the neck-joint with his sharp spear, so the bronze blade severed his tongue at the root and exited between his teeth.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EurypylusEuaemon">Eurypylus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Euaemon">Euaemon</a>’s son, killed noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#HypsenorTrojan">Hypsenor</a>, the son of proud&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dolopion">Dolopion</a>, priest of Scamander, whom the people honoured like a god. Mighty Eurypylus chased him as he fled, and striking him on the shoulder with his sword, lopped off his mighty arm, which tumbled to the ground in a shower of blood. Implacable fate, dark death, enveloped his eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244900">Bk</span><span id="BkV84">V:84-165</span>&nbsp;Pandarus wounds Diomedes</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Such was the furious combat. As for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, none could have said which army Greek or Trojan he fought for, since he stormed over the plain like a raging winter torrent that sweeps away the dykes in its swift flood. Close-built embankments and the walls of fertile vineyards fail to hold its onset driven by Zeus’ storm and before it the proud works of men all tumble to ruin: so the dense ranks of the Trojans were routed by Tydeus’ son, giving way to him despite their numbers.</p>
<p>Yet when glorious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pandarus">Pandarus</a>, Lycaon’s son, saw Diomedes rage across the plain, routing the army ahead, he swiftly bent his curved bow, and aimed at him, striking him firmly, as he ran, on the right shoulder-plate of his cuirass, so the sharp arrow pierced clean through, and the armour ran with blood. Pandarus cried aloud in triumph: ‘On now, brave Trojans, you horse-prickers! The best of the Greeks is hurt, and that arrow means he’s done for, if Lord&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, born of Zeus, truly blessed my journey here from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycia</a>.’</p>
<p>So he boasted, but the swift shaft failed to down Diomedes, who drew back to the shadow of his chariot, where he called to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#SthenelusCapaneus">Sthenelus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Capaneus">Capaneus</a>’ son: ‘Quick, my lad, down here, and pull this bitter dart from my flesh.’</p>
<p>Leaping from the chariot, as he spoke, Sthenelus touched ground beside him and pulled the sharp arrow from his shoulder, so the blood soaked through the woven tunic. Then, Diomedes of the loud war-cry prayed to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Atrytone">Atrytone</a>, hear me, aegis-bearing child of Zeus! If ever with kindly thought you stood by my father in the heat of battle, so now once more, Athene, show your love. Let me kill this man, bring him in range of my spear, who wounded me without warning, boasts of it, and shouts I am not long for the bright light of day.’</p>
<p>He prayed so that Pallas Athene heard, lightening his limbs, his feet and hands, and speaking her winged words in his ear: ‘Courage, Diomedes, I have filled your arteries with your father’s strength, that indomitable strength of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tydeus">Tydeus</a>, shield-wielding horseman. I have driven the mist that veiled them from your eyes what’s more, so you may know both men and gods. Now, if an immortal comes here to test you, among those deathless ones strike only at Aphrodite, Zeus’ daughter, if it be she who risks the battle: since her you may wound with a thrust of your keen blade.’</p>
<p>Bright-eyed Athene departed with those words, and Diomedes once more took his place at the front. Eager though he had been to fight before, his courage now was tripled, like a lion wounded but not killed, as it leaps the fence, by a shepherd as he guards his sheep. He angers it, but now cannot aid them, and has to hide behind walls, while the helpless flock is scattered, downed in heaps together, till the furious creature leaps from the fold. In such a fury great Diomedes attacked the Trojans.</p>

Leaving them lying there, he chased down&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Abas">Abas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PolyidusTrojan">Polyidus</a>, sons of old&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eurydamas">Eurydamas</a>, interpreter of dreams. They came not back again, whom great Diomedes slew, for their father to tell their dreams. Then he pursued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#XanthusPhaenops">Xanthus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThoonPhaenops">Thoön</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phaenops">Phaenops</a>’ dear sons: an old man too weighed down with age to get himself fresh heirs. Diomedes killed both, leaving their sorrowing father to weep when they failed to return, and his surviving kin to inherit.</p>
<p>Two sons of Dardanian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Echemmon">Echemmon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#ChromiusPriam">Chromius</a>&nbsp;were next, as they rode the same chariot. As a lion launches itself on a herd grazing some wooded pasture, and breaks the neck of a heifer or two, so Diomedes dragged those men roughly from their chariot, stripping them of their armour, telling his comrades to drive their horses down to the ships.</p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244901">Bk</span><span id="BkV166">V:166-238</span>&nbsp;Aeneas joins Pandarus in attacking Diomedes</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Seeing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;wreak carnage among the warriors, Prince&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>&nbsp;set out amid the conflict, through a hail of missiles, in search of noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pandarus">Pandarus</a>. He found that mighty peerless son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#LycaonPandarus">Lycaon</a>, and reaching him spoke in his ear: ‘Pandarus, where is your famous bow with its winged arrows? You are our finest archer, better than any in all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycia</a>, come, raise your arms in prayer to Zeus, and aim at that hero, whoever he may be, who is wreaking havoc on us Trojans, loosing the limbs of many a warrior. Take care only lest it is some god, angered with our rites and resentful towards us: for a god’s wrath weighs heavy on us mortals.’</p>
<p>Lycaon’s glorious son replied: ‘Aeneas, wise counsellor to the bronze-clad Trojans: it is indeed the very likeness of brave Tydeus’s son. I’d know him by his shield and helmet-crest, and by his team of horses, yet still it may be a god. And even if it is mortal Diomedes, a god supports him in his rage: one of the immortals, wrapped in mist, stands by him, turning aside my arrows as they reach him. Even now I left fly a shaft that pierced his right shoulder, clean through the armour plate, enough I thought to send him down to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aidoneus">Hades</a>, yet I failed. Surely some god is angry.</p>
<p>I am without chariot or horse to ride, yet in my father Lycaon’s halls, I know there stand eleven fine chariots, newly made and fitted out, cloths spread on them and by each a pair of horses feeding on white barley and on rye. Indeed when I left, Lycaon, as a soldier, gave me strict instructions, advised me to lead my Trojans into the thick of combat with horse and chariot. But I, being I, paid scant attention, though it would have profited me to do so. I spared my glossy horses, thinking fodder would be scarce amongst such a multitude. So I left them there, and came on foot to Troy, trusting to my bow, though to no avail it seems. Twice I have aimed a shaft at their generals, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menelaus">Menelaus</a>&nbsp;and Diomedes, and hit them and drawn blood, yet it only spurred them on. It was an evil day when I took my curved bow from its stand, when I brought my Trojans to Ilium as a favour to noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>. If I have sight again of my native land and the roof of my great hall, and reach my home and wife once more, then may the next stranger take my head if I fail to shatter this bow with my own hands and feed it to the flames, given all the good it’s done me.’</p>
<p>The Trojan general Aeneas replied: ‘Say not so: the way to change this for the better is for us two to face him and test him with our weapons. Climb aboard my chariot, and see what the horses of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#TrosErichtonius">Tros</a>&nbsp;are made of, that cover the ground swiftly in pursuit or in flight. They will carry us back to the city in safety if Zeus gives Diomedes the edge once more. Take up the reins and whip, while I dismount to fight, or you stand your ground while I look to the horses.’</p>
<p>Noble Pandarus answered: ‘Take the reins yourself Aeneas, handle your own horses. They’ll work better for the master they know, if we’re forced to run. For want of your voice to guide them they might startle, and jib at carrying us from the field, leaving fierce Diomedes to close in for the kill. He’d have them then, so drive the team and your own chariot now, while my sharp spear waits to receive him.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkV239"></span><span id="anchor_Toc239244902">Bk V:239-296 The death of Pandarus</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>At this, they mounted the ornate chariot and drove the swift team eagerly towards&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#SthenelusCapaneus">Sthenelus</a>&nbsp;saw them approach, the son of noble Capaneus, and quickly warned Tydeus’ son: ‘Diomedes, dear friend, here come two warriors, strong beyond measure, to fight you. One is the archer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pandarus">Pandarus</a>, who boasts he is son of Lycaon: the other,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, claims&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Anchises">Anchises</a>&nbsp;for a father,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>&nbsp;as his mother. Wheel the chariot and give ground, I beg you, lest you lose your life in the fury of attack.’</p>
<p>Mighty Diomedes with an angry glance replied: ‘Don’t talk to me of flight, that won’t deter me. It is not in my blood to cower away and shirk the fight: my strength’s as great as ever. I’ll not mount the chariot, but face them on foot, as I am. Pallas&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;allows no fear. As for those two the swiftest horses will not let them escape. Now, another thing, take careful note, if Athene in her wisdom grants me the power to kill both, leave our own fine horses here, tie the reins to the chariot rail, run to Aeneas’ team and drive them from the Trojan lines to ours. They are of that breed, the best of all horses under the risen sun, from which Zeus chose a gift for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#TrosErichtonius">Tros</a>, for taking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ganymedes">Ganymedes</a>&nbsp;his son. Lord Anchises later stole the breed, putting his mares to them, unknown to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Laomedon">Laomedon</a>. Six mares foaled in the stables, four he kept for himself rearing them in his stalls, giving the other two to Aeneas, for warhorses. If we could capture those, we would win great glory.’</p>
<p>While they spoke the two arrived at the gallop, and Pandarus called out: ‘Diomedes, the brave and bloody, though my swift bitter shaft failed to fell you, let me try once more with the spear.’ With that he took his stance and hurled the long-shadowed javelin, and the bronze tip struck Diomedes on the shield, piercing it through and reaching his corselet. Pandarus shouted in triumph: ‘A hit, right in the belly. That should finish you, but add to my glory.’</p>
<p>Mighty Diomedes, without a tremor, replied: ‘You’ve failed, not succeeded, but before you two are done one of you must die, and sate with his blood Ares, god of the shield’s tough hide. With that, Diomedes hurled his spear whose bronze blade Athene guided to the face beside the eye, shattering Pandarus’ white teeth, shearing his tongue at the root, and exiting through the chin. He tumbled from the chariot with a clang of bright burnished armour, the swift horses swerved, and there his strength failed, his spirit was loosed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, grasping his shield and long spear, leapt down after him, fearful the Achaeans might rob him of the corpse. He bestrode it like a lion confident in his strength, covering himself with his round shield, ready to slay with his spear any man who would seize the corpse, raising his mighty war-cry. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;hefted a rock, heavier than any two men of our time might carry, lifting it easily on his own. With it he struck Aeneas on the hip where the thigh turns in the hip-joint, the cup-bone men call it. It crushed the bone, sheared the sinews, and jaggedly ripped the skin away. Aeneas fell to his knees, and pressed the ground with one great hand, while darkness shrouded his sight.</p>

<p>‘The combat between Aeneas and Diomedes’ - Crispijn van de Passe (I), 1613</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now Aeneas would have died, had not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, Zeus’ daughter, been quick to notice, the mother who bore him to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Anchises">Anchises</a>&nbsp;while he tended the herd. She flung her white arms about her beloved son, and spread a fold of her shining robe to shelter him from weapons, lest a bronze spear hurled from a swift Danaan chariot might pierce his breast and end his life.</p>
<p>While she was bearing her son from the field,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#SthenelusCapaneus">Sthenelus</a>&nbsp;obeyed the command of Diomedes of the loud war-cry, and kept his team from the fight, tying their reins to the chariot rim, and running towards Aeneas’ long-maned pair. He drove them out of the Trojan ranks towards the Greeks, and entrusted them to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Deipylus">Deipylus</a>, his close comrade, whom he honoured most among all the friends of his youth, because they were kindred spirits. He told him to lead them down to the hollow ships. Then he mounted his chariot, seized the gleaming reins, and urged his powerful horses in ready pursuit of Diomedes.</p>
<p>That son of Tydeus meanwhile, with pitiless spear, was chasing after Cyprian Aphrodite, knowing she was a gentle goddess, not one of those who control the flow of battle, no&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Enyo">Enyo</a>, sacker of cities. So, when he reached her after his chase through the ranks, fierce Diomedes lunged at her with his sharp spear, piercing the divine robe the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Graces">Graces</a>&nbsp;had laboured to make for her, and wounding the flesh of her wrist near the palm. Out streamed the deathless goddess’ blood, the ichor that flows in ambrosial veins, for the gods do not eat mortal bread or drink mortal wine, but lacking our blood are called immortals. With a piercing cry she let fall her son, whom Phoebus Apollo clasped in his arms, wrapped in a dark blue cloud, lest a bronze spear hurled from a swift Danaan chariot might pierce his breast and end his life.</p>
<p>Over her Diomedes of the loud war-cry raised a great shout of triumph: ‘Daughter of Zeus, leave battle and strife to others. Isn’t it enough that you snare feeble women? Rejoin the fight and you’ll learn to shudder at the name of war!’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244904">Bk</span><span id="BkV352">V:352-430</span>&nbsp;Aphrodite returns to Olympus</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As he spoke,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iris">Iris</a>, swift-footed as the wind, led&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>&nbsp;from the conflict, her lovely flesh stained with blood, and she distraught with pain, and suffering grievously. They found fierce&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ares">Ares</a>, on the left flank, his two war-horses, with their golden harness, close by, his spear leaning on a cloud. Sinking to her knees, she begged the loan of her dear brother’s steeds: ‘Save me, brother dear, lend me your team, to reach&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Olympus">Olympus</a>, my home among the immortals. I am sorely hurt by this wound, dealt by a mortal, son of Tydeus, who would challenge Father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;himself.’</p>
<p>At this, Ares lent her his horses with the golden harness, and sick at heart she mounted the chariot with Iris beside her, who took up the reins, and whipped up the team, which eagerly galloped away. Swiftly they reached the heights of Olympus, home of the gods, and there swift-footed Iris reined in the horses, unyoked them, and threw them ambrosial fodder, while lovely Aphrodite ran to kneel at her mother&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dione">Dione</a>’s feet. Taking her daughter in her arms, Dione soothed her, saying: Which of the heavenly ones has hurt you so spitefully, dear child, as if you deserved punishment?’</p>
<p>Laughter-loving Aphrodite said: ‘Reckless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, Tydeus’ son, it was who wounded me, as I rescued my dear son Aeneas, dearest of all to me, from the field. This fierce feud’s no longer one between Greeks and Trojans: now the Danaans are at war with the gods themselves.’</p>
<p>The lovely goddess, Dione, replied: ‘Courage my child, and bear your pain well. Many of us who dwell on Olympus have suffered at the hands of men, attempting to injure one another. So Ares, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OtusEphialtes">Otus</a>&nbsp;and the mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Ephialtes">Ephialtes</a>, the sons of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aloeus">Aloeus</a>, bound him cruelly, trapped for thirteen months in a bronze jar. That would have been the end of Ares the warmonger, if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eeriboea">Eriboea</a>&nbsp;the sons’ lovely stepmother had not told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hermes">Hermes</a>, who spirited away the suffering Ares, almost at the end of his tether.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, too felt the agony, when the mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Heracles">Heracles</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amphitryon">Amphitryon</a>, pierced her right breast with his triple-barbed arrow. And even great Hades himself was stricken by a swift shaft, when that same hero, aegis-bearing Zeus’ son, wounded him at the Gate of Hell, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pylos">Pylos</a>, among the dead, leaving him in agony. Hades fled to the house of Zeus, to high Olympus, shaken to the core and in great pain, for the arrow had pierced his mighty shoulder, and his heart was labouring. There&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paeeon">Paeon</a>&nbsp;the Healer spread soothing herbs on the wound, and cured Hades, one not made as mortals are. A harsh and violent man Heracles, and careless of doing evil: who even troubled the Olympians with his bow. And now a goddess, bright-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>, sets this man Diomedes against you, a fool unconscious how brief life is for those who war with the gods. There’ll be no homecoming for him, from the horrors of battle: no more will his children prattle at his knee. Let him take care, mighty horse-tamer that he is, lest he meets with a greater force than you and one day his noble wife&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aegialeia">Aegialeia</a>, wise daughter of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AdrastusSicyon">Adrastus</a>, wakes her close servants from their sleep with her long lament, wailing for the best of the Achaeans.’ So saying, with both hands she wiped the ichor from her daughter’s arm. The wound was healed and the pain was eased.</p>
<p>Athene and Hera, who were watching, tried to provoke Zeus with mocking words. Bright-eyed Athene was the first to speak: ‘Father Zeus, I hope you won’t be angry at what I say. It seems your Cyprian daughter has been at work luring some Greek girl to chase after those Trojans she loves so deeply, and while fondling this girl and her golden brooch, scratched her own delicate hand.’</p>
<p>This only drew a smile from the Father of men and gods. Calling golden Aphrodite to his side, he said: ‘War is not for you, my child, tend to the loving deeds of wedlock, and leave the fighting to Ares the swift and to Athene.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244905">Bk</span><span id="BkV431">V:431-518</span>&nbsp;Apollo intervenes on the battlefield</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As they spoke,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;of the loud war-cry flung himself at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>&nbsp;once more, whom he well knew Apollo protected, caring nothing for that great god, and eager to kill Aeneas and strip him of his shining armour. Three times he leapt at him threateningly three times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;beat away his gleaming shield. But when like a demon he rushed at him a fourth time, far-striking Apollo gave a terrible cry: ‘Take thought, son of Tydeus, and give way! Don’t think yourself equal to the gods: the immortals are of a different race than those who walk the earth.’</p>
<p>Diomedes, at this, gave ground a little, before far-striking Apollo’s anger, while the god bore Aeneas far from the field to his temple on sacred&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pergamus">Pergamus</a>. There in the great sanctuary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Leto">Leto</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Artemis">Artemis</a>&nbsp;the Huntress, healed him and made him more glorious still, while Apollo, Lord of the Silver Bow, formed a phantom in Aeneas’ likeness, armed like him, round which the Trojans and noble Greeks hacked at the bull’s hide shields protecting each other’s breasts, the great round shields and lighter bucklers. Then Phoebus Apollo called to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ares">Ares</a>: ‘You, destroyer of men and bloody sacker of cities, Ares, enter the fray and drive this son of Tydeus off, who would fight Father Zeus himself. He wounded Aphrodite’s wrist, then lunged at me like a demon!’</p>
<p>While Apollo took to the heights of Pergamus, lethal Ares joined the Trojan ranks, masked as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AcamasEussorus">Acamas</a>&nbsp;the dashing Thracian leader. He called to the Zeus-blessed sons of Priam: ‘How long will you watch our men fall to the Greeks? Are they free to storm our very gates? Aeneas has fallen, Anchises’ son, whom we honour as much as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>. Come, save our brave comrade from the din of battle.’</p>
<p>So saying, he roused their fighting spirit, while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>&nbsp;dealt noble Hector a stern rebuke: ‘Where is the courage you used to show, Hector? Did you think to hold the city without allied troops, relying only on your brothers and brothers-in-law? And where are they? I see nary a one. They cower like dogs before a lion, while we who are simply allies do the fighting. And a long journey it was here. In far off&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycia</a>, by eddying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#XanthusLycia">Xanthus</a>, I left my darling wife and infant son, and great possessions too that any man would envy. Yet I urge on my Lycians, ready to fight myself, though there is nothing here of mine for the Greeks to carry off or drive away; while you stand there, not even bidding your men hold and defend their women. Beware lest you and they are snared in the net and fall an easy prey to your foes. They will soon lay waste to your proud city. This should be your care, day and night: and you should beg the leaders of your noble allies to be firm and resolute, if you wish to avoid blame.’</p>
<p>Hector was deeply stung by his words. At once, he leapt fully-armed from his chariot, and brandishing two sharp spears, went through the ranks urging them to fight, rousing their martial spirit. They turned about then to face the Greeks, who closed ranks awaiting them, refusing to retreat. As the breeze blows chaff across the sacred threshing-floor, when golden-haired&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Demeter">Demeter</a>&nbsp;sends drafts of air to winnow the grain, whitening the chaff-heaps, so now the Greeks were whitened by the dust that settled on head and shoulders as the fight was joined and the chariots wheeled round, dust thrown to a copper-coloured sky by the horses’ hooves. They met the shock, while fierce Ares, ranging everywhere, threw a dark veil round the fight, to aid the Trojans, fulfilling Apollo of the Golden Sword’s command. Phoebus had asked him to rouse the Trojans’ spirits, when he saw Pallas&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;withdraw from aiding the Greeks. And Apollo sent Aeneas forth from the great sanctuary, and filled the general with courage. He took his place in the ranks, and his friends rejoiced to see him alive and whole, and brimming with valour. Not that they had time to question him, since Apollo of the Silver Bow, Ares destroyer of men, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eris">Strife</a>&nbsp;in her ceaseless rage, drove them on to battle.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244906">Bk</span><span id="BkV519">V:519-589</span>&nbsp;The Greeks prevail</h3>
<p></p>
<p>On their side&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;and the two&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Aiantes</a>, urged on the Greeks who, fearless of the violent Trojan onslaught, stood their ground, unmoving as the mist with which Zeus caps the mountain tops in calm weather, when angry Boreas and the other winds are sleeping, with all their fierce gusts that send the dark clouds fleeing. So did the Greeks stand firm against the Trojans and held their place.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>’s commanding voice echoed through the ranks: ‘Be men, my friends, take heart, fear nothing but dishonour in other’s eyes. When men shun shame, more survive than not, in flight there is no glory, no salvation.’</p>
<p>So saying, he swiftly hurled his spear striking a comrade of brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Deicoon">Deicoön</a>&nbsp;son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pergasus">Pergasus</a>, whom the Trojans honoured like a son of Priam, for his readiness to fight in the vanguard. The spear struck his shield, and meeting little resistance passed straight through, past his belt and into the lower belly. He fell with a thud, and a crash of armour.</p>
<p>Aeneas in reply killed two Danaan champions,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Crethon">Crethon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Orsilochusson">Orsilochus</a>&nbsp;sons of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diocles">Diocles</a>, whose father lived in noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PheraeDiocles">Pherae</a>. A man of substance, his line began with the river-god&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Alpheius">Alpheus</a>, whose broad stream flows through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pylos">Pylian</a>&nbsp;lands, and whose son was the great King&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Orsilochusfather">Orsilochus</a>. He begat Diocles in turn, whose sons these were, skilled in warfare. Reaching manhood, they followed the Argives to horse-breeding Troy in the black ships, to win compensation for the Atreidae. Now their voyage ended there in death. Like a pair of lions reared in a mountain-thicket that prey on the farmers’ fine sheep and cattle till they themselves fall to the bronze blade, so these two at the hands of Aeneas were toppled like tall firs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menelaus">Menelaus</a>, dear to Ares, pitied their fate, and strode through the foremost ranks, in red-bronze armour, shaking his spear; yet Ares breathed power into him, seeking his death also at the hands of Aeneas. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Antilochus">Antilochus</a>, brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a>’s son, fearing for Menelaus, and the frustration of all their efforts, followed him through the ranks. He found Aeneas and Menelaus threatening each other with spears, ready to fight, and Aeneas, seeing them joined against him, retreated while they, dragging their dead towards the Greek line, relinquished the sad corpses to their comrades and turned again to fight in the vanguard.</p>
<p>Then the pair killed warlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pylaemenes">Pylaemenes</a>, leader of the brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paphlagonians">Paphlagonian</a>&nbsp;fighters. The great spearman Menelaus struck him with a spear where he stood shattering the collarbone, while Antilochus dealt with his squire the charioteer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#MydonPaphlagonian">Mydon</a>, noble son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Atymnius">Atymnius</a>, who was wheeling the horses round, and struck him with a stone on the elbow. The reins, with their ivory trappings, fell from his hand to the ground. Antilochus ran in and sank his sword in his temple, so he fell sprawling with a gasp and buried his head and shoulders in the dust. It was deep sand where he fell and he hung there for a moment, till his flailing horses knocked him prone. Then Antilochus touched his whip to them, and drove them off into the Greek lines.</p>

<h3><span id="BkV590"></span><span id="anchor_Toc239244907">Bk V:590-702 The wounding of Sarpedon</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;had spied them through the ranks, and rushed towards them with a cry, the serried ranks of the Trojans behind him.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ares">Ares</a>&nbsp;led them on with the goddess&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Enyo">Enyo</a>, war’s merciless clamour in her train, Ares brandishing a huge spear, ranged now in front of Hector now behind him.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;of the loud war-cry, dismayed at the sight of Ares, turned round, like a traveller crossing a wide plain who halts thwarted by a swift sea-bound river seething with foam, and called to his men: ‘My friends, no wonder noble Hector, the spearman and daring warrior, fills us with wonder, for a god is always by his side to save him from ruin. Ares is there, now, masked as a mortal. Retreat but keep your faces to the enemy, and show no eagerness to fight the gods.’</p>
<p>As he spoke, the Trojans were upon them, and Hector killed two veteran warriors riding the one chariot,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menesthes">Menesthes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Anchialus">Anchialus</a>. Telemonian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>&nbsp;felt pity at their fall and, taking his stand nearby, with a cast of his glittering javelin struck&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AmphiusSelagus">Amphius</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Selagus">Selagus</a>, a rich farmer of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paesus">Paesus</a>, owner of many fields, whom fate had led to serve as an ally to Priam and his sons. Telamonian Ajax struck Amphius on the belt, such that the long spear pierced the lower belly, and he toppled with a thud. But when the mighty Ajax ran in to strip him of his armour, the Trojans unleashed a volley of glittering javelins, a host of which he caught on his shield. Yet he planted his foot on the corpse, and dragged the bronze spear from the wound, failing only to strip it of its fine armour, due to a shower of missiles. Moreover he feared the brave Trojans stout defence, who faced him in ample numbers, spear in hand. Tall, powerful, and dauntless though he was they forced him back till he staggered and gave ground.</p>
<p>So they struggled in mighty combat. Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#TlepolemusHeracles">Tlepolemus</a>, the tall strong son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Heracles">Heracles</a>, was roused by overriding fate to fight godlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>. When these two, a son and a grandson of Zeus the Cloud-maker, were within range Tlepolemus cried: ‘Sarpedon, Counsellor of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycians</a>, and a man ignorant of war, why are you skulking here? It can’t be true you’re a son of aegis-bearing Zeus, inferior as you are to the warriors he engendered in ancient times. Men say great Heracles, my father, was of another make, staunch in the fight, and with a lion’s heart. He came here for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Laomedon">Laomedon</a>’s mares, bringing a smaller army and only six ships, yet he sacked Ilium and razed its streets. Yours though is a coward’s heart, and your numbers are waning. Strong though you think you are, your journey from Lycia to bolster Troy is doomed, since you will fall to my hand and pass through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>’ gate.’</p>
<p>Sarpedon of the Lycians replied: ‘It’s true, Tlepolemus, that Heracles your father razed holy Ilium, because of proud Laomedon’s foolishness, who repaid his efforts with insults, and denied him the mares he had journeyed far to win. But here only death and dark fate await you, at my hands. Downed by my spear you will yield me the glory, and Hades the Horse Lord your spirit.’</p>
<p>As Sarpedon finished, Tlepolemus raised his ash spear high, and the long shafts leapt from both men’s hands in an instant. Sarpedon’s struck square on the neck, and the deadly point sliced clean through, so the darkness of night shrouded Tlepolemus’ sight. His own spear, striking Sarpedon on the left thigh, had passed on furiously, grazing the bone, though the Father saved the son from death.</p>
<p>His loyal followers bore godlike Sarpedon from the field, while, in their haste and the effort it cost them, not one of them had time to pull the ashen spear from his wound so he might stand, and the javelin dragged on his flesh as it trailed along.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the bronze-greaved Achaeans carried Tlepolemus out of battle, watched by the great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>, steadfast of heart, whose spirit raged within him. He debated in his mind whether to pursue Sarpedon, Zeus the Thunderer’s son, or wreak more havoc among the Lycians. Yet Fate did not wish that mighty son of Zeus to die by Odysseus’ sword, and so on the Lycian host&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;turned his fury. He killed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#CoeranusLycian">Coeranus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#ChromiusLycian">Chromius</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AlastorLycian">Alastor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Halius">Halius</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Alcandrus">Alcandrus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#NoemonTrojan">Noemon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Prytanis">Prytanis</a>. More of the Lycians would have died at noble Odysseus’ hands, but for Hector’s quick eye, he of the glittering helm, who strode to the front in his red-bronze armour, filling the Greeks with terror. Sarpedon, Zeus’ son, joyed at his coming, and called to him in distress: ‘Son of Priam, save me: don’t leave me a prey to the Danaans, and if I must die, and never see my own home again, nor in returning bring joy to my wife and child, let me at least die in your city.’</p>
<p>Hector of the glittering helm gave no answer to his words, but sped by swiftly, eager to stall the Greeks and kill them en masse. But godlike Sarpedon was seated by loyal friends under a fine oak-tree sacred to aegis-bearing Zeus, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PelagonLycian">Pelagon</a>&nbsp;his close comrade drew the ash spear from his thigh. His breath failed, and mist shrouded his eyes, but he breathed again as the North Wind blew across him, bringing him new life when he had fairly loosed his spirit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Greeks, seeing Ares at war for the Trojans, threatened by him and bronze-clad Hector, unable to stand the onslaught, but refusing to flee for the black ships, fell back steadily.</p>

<p>And when the goddess, white-armed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>&nbsp;saw the slaughter of Argives in mortal combat, she swiftly spoke winged words to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>: ‘Oh, child of aegis-bearing Zeus,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Atrytone">Atrytone</a>, if we let savage Ares rage like this, what use our pledge to Menelaus that he’d raze the high walls of Troy before returning home? Come let us too think of wild bravery.’</p>
<p>Bright-eyed Athene hastened to obey her words. Hera, the great goddess, daughter of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cronos">Cronos</a>, ran to harness her steeds with gold, while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hebe">Hebe</a>&nbsp;swiftly fitted the eight-spoked wheels of bronze on the chariot’s iron axle. The felloes of these are imperishable gold: the tires are bronze, a wonder to see; while the whirling hubs are silver. The platform is woven with straps of silver and gold, with a double rail, and a long silver pole to which she fastened the golden yoke and breast-straps. Then Hera, eager for war’s alarums, led her swift horses under the yoke.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Athene, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, shed her soft richly embroidered robe the work of her own two hands, at her Father’s threshold, dressed herself in the tunic of Zeus the Cloud-Driver, and donned her armour ready for sad war. She threw the dreadful tasselled aegis about her shoulders, crowned at every point with terror, violence and strife within, adorned with the monstrous image of the Gorgon’s head, grim and awful emblem of aegis-bearing Zeus. She set on her head the golden helmet with its four cones and double-crest, adorned with warriors of a hundred cities. Then she set foot on the fiery chariot, grasped her huge, strong, weighty spear, with which this daughter of a mighty Father shatters the ranks in anger.</p>
<p>At once, Hera whipped up the horses, and Heaven’s Gates of themselves groaned open on their hinges, gates that the Hours guard, the wardens of wide heaven and Olympus, to veil or reveal as they see fit. Through the gates they drove their steady horses, and found the Son of Cronos sitting alone on the topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus. There white-armed Hera reined in the horses, and questioned lofty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>: ‘Father are you not seething with indignation at Ares for this violence that has laid a vast army of noble Achaeans low, with reckless abandon, to my great sorrow? Cyprian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, Lord of the Silver Bow, are delighted at loosing this lawless savage. Will you be angry, Father Zeus, if I smite Ares hard and drive him from the field?’</p>
<p>‘Then rouse Athene, ever first to chase the spoils, and let her face him,’ Zeus the Cloud-Gatherer replied. ‘She, above all, is wont to cause him pain.’</p>
<p></p>
<h3><span id="BkV767"></span><span id="anchor_Toc239244909">Bk V:767-845 Athene fights alongside Diomedes</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The goddess, white-armed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, sped to obey his order, flicking the horses with her whip, and the willing pair set a course between earth and the starry heavens. Those thundering horses of the gods cover the distance at one bound that a man can see through the distant haze, gazing from a watchtower over the wine-dark deep. They soon reached Troy, land of the two rivers, and there at the meeting of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Simois">Simoïs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Scamander">Scamander</a>, the white-armed goddess Hera reined in her horses, and loosed them from the yoke. With a deep mist she veiled them, while Simoïs made ambrosia spring up for them to graze. Then the two goddesses strutted forward, like bold pigeons, in their eagerness to aid the Argive army.</p>
<p>When they had reached the place where a picked force of Achaeans, ranged like ravenous lions or formidable wild boars, had gathered round mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, tamer of horses, the goddess, white-armed Hera halted and called aloud, imitating bronze-voiced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Stentor">Stentor</a>’s great shout louder than fifty men: ‘Shame on you, Greeks, fine to view, but contemptible within! When noble Achilles led the fight no Trojan dared to leave the Dardanian Gates, they feared his great spear so much, but now far from their city they fight by your hollow ships.’</p>
<p>With these words she roused the courage and daring in every man. Meanwhile bright-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;seeing Tydeus’ son, beside his horses and chariot, airing the arrow-wound&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pandarus">Pandarus</a>&nbsp;dealt, ran swiftly to his side. Beneath the broad shoulder-strap of his round shield the sweat was irking him, and he lifted the strap to wipe away the dark blood beneath his weakened arm. The goddess laid her hand on the chariot yoke saying: ‘Tydeus’ son is hardly like his father. Small though he was he was a fighter. Even when I wanted him not to fight or make a row, when he strode alone into the crowd of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cadmeians">Cadmeians</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThebesBoeotia">Thebes</a>, bearing them a message, even when I’d told him to sit and banquet quietly in their hall, he with his great heart had to challenge the Cadmeian youth, and beat them easily, as ever, though with my help. But you, I stand by your side, I shield you from harm, ready to urge you on against the Trojans, yet you seem too weary to attack again, or are robbed of your strength by fear. If that is so, then you are no child of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tydeus">Tydeus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Oeneus">Oeneus</a>’ warlike son!’</p>
<p>‘I know you, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus,’ answered mighty Diomedes, ‘so I will speak freely hiding nothing. Neither blind fear nor weariness possess me, I am merely obeying your command not to fight with the gods face to face, unless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>&nbsp;daughter of Zeus enters the fray, when I might wound her with my keen blade. It is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ares">Ares</a>&nbsp;I see controlling the field of war, so I have retreated and told the rest of the Argives to gather here round me.’</p>
<p>‘Dearest Diomedes, true son of Tydeus,’ bright-eyed Athene replied, ‘have no fear of Ares now or any of the immortals, and I will be here beside you to defend you. Drive your swift steeds towards him, and strike him at close range. Be not in awe of Ares raging in his fury, treacherous plague that he is, who promised Hera and I just now he would aid the Greeks against the Trojans, but now forgets what he swore and fights for Troy.’</p>
<p>She reached out, as she spoke, and grasping&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#SthenelusCapaneus">Sthenelus</a>&nbsp;hustled him from the chariot, he being quick to go, she mounting beside Diomedes, eager herself for battle. The beech-wood axle groaned beneath its burden, weighed down by the mighty warrior and the fearsome goddess. Pallas Athene grasped the reins, and whipped the swift horses towards Ares, as he stripped the armour from vast&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PeriphasAetolian">Periphas</a>, noble son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Ochesius">Ochesius</a>, and pride of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aetolia">Aetolians</a>.

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244910">Bk</span><span id="BkV846">V:846-909</span>&nbsp;Diomedes wounds Ares</h3>
<p></p>
<p>But the moment&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ares">Ares</a>, bane of the living, glimpsed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, he left vast&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PeriphasAetolian">Periphas</a>&nbsp;where he had killed him, and headed straight for the horse-tamer. When they were at close quarters, Ares thrust with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke, at Diomedes, eager to strike him dead: but bright-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;caught the spear in her hand, and drove it above the chariot to spend its force in the air. Now, Diomedes, of the loud war-cry, drove his bronze-spear at Ares, and Pallas Athene drove it home into the lower belly, where he wore a defensive apron. There the thrust landed, tearing the flesh, and Diomedes wrenched it free again. Then brazen Ares bellowed as loud as ten thousand warriors shout in battle, when they meet in the war-god’s shadow. The Greeks and Trojans trembled with fear at insatiable Ares’ cry.</p>
<p>Like the dark column that whirls from the cloud when a tornado forms in heated air, so brazen Ares seemed to Diomedes, as he sped through the sky to high heaven. Swiftly he reached the gods’ home on steep Olympus, and sat down at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>’ side, in anguish. Ares showed Zeus the divine ichor flowing from the wound, and spoke in a plaintive voice: ‘Father Zeus, does it not stir your indignation to see all this violence? We gods always suffer cruelly at each other’s hands when we show mortals favour. We are all at odds with you because you cursed the world with that mad daughter of yours who is ever bent on lawlessness. The rest of us Olympians obey you and bow to you, but you say and do nothing to stop her antics, you condone them rather, simply because this girl who wreaks havoc is yours. Now she spurs on foolhardy Diomedes to vent his anger on us immortals. First in a close encounter he wounded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>&nbsp;on the wrist then he ran at me like a very demon. Quick on my feet, I sprang away, or I would have suffered there for ages among the grisly dead, or been crippled by his spear-blows.</p>
<p>Zeus, the Cloud-gatherer, turned on him angrily: ‘Don’t come here to whine, you backslider. Strife, conflict, and war are all you care for, so much so that I loathe you more than all the other Olympians. You share your mother&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>’s intolerable, headstrong spirit; she too will scarcely obey my word. I suspect she prompted this and caused your wound. Yet as my offspring I’ll not let you suffer, since it was to me she bore you, though if any other god had fathered so violent a son, you’d have been ranked below the sons of Uranus, long ago.’</p>
<p>So saying, he ordered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paeeon">Paeon</a>&nbsp;to heal him, by spreading soothing ointment on the wound, for Ares was no mortal. He healed the fierce god as swiftly as fig-juice thickens milk that curdles when stirred. Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hebe">Hebe</a>&nbsp;bathed him, and dressed him in fine clothes, and he sat down again by Zeus’ side, in all his former glory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hera of Argos and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Alalcomenean">Alalcomenean</a>&nbsp;Athene returned to great Zeus’ palace, having forced Ares, bane of the living, to end his murderous progress.</p>

<p>So the Greeks and Trojans were left to their grim conflict, and the battle, in a hail of bronze-tipped spears, surged this way and that over the plain, between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Simois">Simoïs</a>&nbsp;and the streams of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#XanthusTroy">Xanthus</a>.</p>
<p>Telamonian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>, bulwark of the Achaeans, was the first to shatter a Trojan company and give his comrades hope, felling the best of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thrace">Thracian</a>&nbsp;warriors,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AcamasEussorus">Acamas</a>, tall and powerful son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eussorus">Eussorus</a>. He struck him first on the ridge of his horsehair-crested helmet, and drove the bronze spear-point into the bone, so darkness filled his eyes.</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, of the loud war-cry, killed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Axylus">Axylus</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#TeuthrasTrojan">Teuthras</a>.

But none of his friends were there that day to face the enemy and save him from his sad fate; for Diomedes killed both him and his charioteer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Calesius">Calesius</a>, and they went down under the earth.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Euryalus">Euryalus</a>&nbsp;killed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dresus">Dresus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OpheltiusTrojan">Opheltius</a>&nbsp;then chased down&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AesepusTrojan">Aesepus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PedasusTrojan">Pedasus</a>, whom the water-nymph&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Abarbarea">Abarbarea</a>&nbsp;bore to peerless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Bucolion">Bucolion</a>.

<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menelaus">Menelaus</a>, of the loud war-cry, took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AdrastusTrojan1">Adrastus</a>&nbsp;alive, for the man’s horses bolting across the plain in terror tangled with a tamarisk bough and, snapping the shaft where it met the chariot, fled towards the city caught up in the general rout: but Adrastus was flung from the chariot and landed face down in the dust beside a wheel. Menelaus, son of Atreus, was soon before him, grasping a long-shadowed spear. Then Adrastus clasped him by the knees and begged: ‘Take me alive, son of Atreus, and win a noble ransom; there are great treasures of iron, bronze, and gold finely-worked in my rich father’s house. He would pay you a mighty ransom if he heard I’d been taken alive to a Greek ship.’</p>
<p>So he tried to soften the other’s heart, and Menelaus, it is true, was about to send him off with a squire to the swift Achaean ships, when Agamemnon arrived at the run, calling out: ‘Dear Menelaus, why such compassion? Were these Trojans kind to you back home? Let none escape death at our hands, not even the child in the womb; let not a one survive, let all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ilium">Ilium</a>&nbsp;die: leave none behind as witnesses to mourn.’</p>
<p>His brother’s mind was changed by his words of wisdom; and Menelaus thrust Adrastus away for the king to spear him in the side. Backward he fell and the son of Atreus, planting his foot on his chest, drew forth the ashen spear.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a> was shouting loudly, calling out to the Greeks: ‘My friends, you sons of Ares, Danaan warriors, no lingering here in your eagerness to loot, so you might scurry back to the ships carrying the best spoils. Let us kill these men; then you may strip the corpses on the field at your ease.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244953">Bk</span><span id="BkVI72">VI:72-118</span> Helenus asks Hector to urge the City to pray</h3>
<p>His words filled every man with fresh strength and courage. The Trojans would have been driven back to Ilium, defeated and disheartened by the Greek attack, if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#HelenusPriam">Helenus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>’s son, the greatest augur in Troy, had not found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>: ‘You two above all command the Trojan and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycian</a>&nbsp;effort, since you are the finest in war and counsel in every way. Gather the troops, and make a stand before the gates, lest they end by throwing themselves into their women’s arms and our enemies rejoice. When you have rallied every company, we’ll hold our ground and fight the Greeks here, weary as we are, since fate demands it. Then go to the city, Hector, and speak to our mother,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>. Let her gather the older women on the Acropolis, at bright-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>’s shrine: unlock the doors of the sacred temple, and lay on the knees of shining-haired Athene, the largest and loveliest robe from the palace, the one she prizes most. Then let her make a vow to sacrifice a dozen yearling heifers, unused to the goad, in her temple, so that she may take pity on Troy, and the Trojan women and children, and keep that savage warrior&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;from Ilium, that great panic-maker, who I say has proved the mightiest of the Greeks. Not even Achilles, prince of men, is as feared, and he they say is son of a goddess. This son of Tydeus, in his merciless rage, is unrivalled in his power.’</p>
<p>Hector promptly obeyed, and fully-armed leapt down from his chariot. Brandishing two sharp spears he went everywhere among the men, urging them on, and stirring the hum of battle. They wheeled about and turned to face the Greeks, who then gave ground and stopped their slaughter, thinking some god had come from the starry heavens to assist the Trojans, they rallied now so strongly. Hector cried aloud to the army: ‘Brave Trojans, and glorious allies, my friends, be men and think on furious valour, while I enter Ilium and tell our wives and Elders to pray to the gods and promise sacrifice.’</p>
<p>With this, Hector of the gleaming helm, departed, and as he went the black leather rim that ran round the outermost edge of his bossed shield tapped at his ankles and his neck.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244954">Bk</span><span id="BkVI119">VI:119-211</span> Glaucus meets Diomedes and tells his lineage</h3>
<p>Now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#GlaucusHippolochus">Glaucus</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#HippolochusBellerephon">Hippolochus</a>, met in the space between the armies, eager for the fight. When they had come within range, the son of Tydeus, he of the loud war-cry, called: ‘What mighty man are you, among mortals? I have never seen you on the field of honour before today, yet facing my long-shadowed spear, you show greater daring than all the rest. Unhappy are those whose sons meet my fury. But if you be one of the gods from heaven, I will not fight with the immortals. Not even mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycurgus">Lycurgus</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#DryasLycurgus">Dryas</a>, survived his war with the gods for long. He chased the nymphs, who nursed frenzied&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, through the sacred hills of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nysa">Nysa</a>, and struck by the murderous man’s ox-goad their holy wands fell from their hands. But Dionysus fleeing, plunged beneath the waves, trembling and terrified by the man’s loud cries, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>&nbsp;took him to her breast. Then the gods who take their ease were angered by Lycurgus, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;blinded him. So that, hated by the immortals, he soon died. No way then would I wish to oppose the blessed gods. But if you are mortal, and eat the food men grow, come on, and meet the toils of fate the sooner.’</p>
<p>‘Brave Diomedes’, Hippolochus’ son replied, ‘why ask my lineage? Like the generations of leaves are those of men. The wind blows and one year’s leaves are scattered on the ground, but the trees bud and fresh leaves open when spring comes again. So a generation of men is born as another passes away. Still if you wish to know my lineage, listen well to what others know already. There’s a town called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Ephyre">Ephyre</a>&nbsp;in a corner of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Argos">Argos</a>, the horse-pasture, and a man lived there called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sisyphus">Sisyphus</a>, the craftiest of men, a son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeolus">Aeolus</a>. He had a son called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#GlaucusBellerophon">Glaucus</a>, and Glaucus was father of peerless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Bellerophon">Bellerophon</a>, to whom the gods gave beauty and every manly grace. But Zeus made him subject to King&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Proetus">Proetus</a>, who was stronger and plotted against him, and drove him from Argive lands. Now Proetus’ wife, the fair&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Anteia">Anteia</a>, longed madly for Bellerephon, and begged him to lie with her in secret, but wise Bellerephon was a righteous man and could not be persuaded. So she wove a web of deceit, and said to King Proetus: ‘Kill this Bellerephon, who tried to take me by force, or die in the doing of it.’ The king was angered by her words. He would not kill Bellerephon, as his heart shrank from murder, but he packed him off to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycia</a>, and scratching many deadly signs on a folded tablet, gave him that fatal token, and told him to hand it to the Lycian king, his father-in-law, so to engineer his death. Bellerephon went to Lycia escorted by peerless gods, and when he reached the streams of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#XanthusLycia">Xanthus</a>&nbsp;the king of great Lycia welcomed him with honour, entertaining him for nine days, and sacrificing nine oxen. But when rosy-fingered Dawn lit the tenth day his host questioned him, and asked what token he brought him from his son-in-law Proetus.</p>
<p>On first deciphering the fatal message, he ordered Bellerephon to kill the monstrous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Chimaera">Chimaera</a>, spawned by gods and not men, that had a lion’s head, goat’s body and serpent’s tail, and breathed out deadly blasts of scorching fire. But Bellerephon slew her, guided by the gods. Next he was sent against the notorious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Solymi">Solymi</a>, and fought, he said, the mightiest battle he ever fought. Then thirdly he slaughtered the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amazons">Amazons</a>, women the equal of men. The king planned a deadly ruse for his return, staging an ambush by the pick of the Lycian warriors. But not one of them returned: the peerless Bellerephon killed them all. The king then realised he was a true son of the gods, and offered him his daughter and half of his kingdom, to stay. The Lycians moreover marked out for him an estate of the first rank, with tracts of orchards and plough-land for his delight.</p>
<p>The lady bore Bellerephon, that warlike man, three children,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Isander">Isander</a>, Hippolochus and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Laodameia">Laodameia</a>. Zeus the Counsellor slept with Laodameia and she bore godlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>, now a bronze-clad warrior. But the time came when Bellerephon too was loathed by the gods, and wandered off alone over the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AleianPlain">Aleian</a>&nbsp;plain, eating his heart away and shunning the ways of men. Ares, unwearied by war, killed his son Isander, battling with the glorious Solymi; and Laodameia was slain in anger by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Artemis">Artemis</a>&nbsp;of the Golden Reins. Hippolochus remained and fathered me, and from him I claim descent. He sent me here to Troy and charged me earnestly to be the best and bravest, and not bring shame on my ancestors the best men in Ephyre and all broad Lycia. Such is my lineage, from that blood am I sprung.’</p>
<p>Diomedes, of the loud war-cry rejoiced at these words. Planting his spear in the fertile earth, he spoke to the Lycian general courteously: ‘You are, then, a friend of long-standing to my father’s house, since noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Oeneus">Oeneus</a>&nbsp;once entertained peerless Bellerephon in his palace, and kept him there twenty days. Moreover they exchanged fine friendship gifts. Oeneus gave him a bright scarlet belt, and Bellerephon replied with a two-handled gold cup, which was there in the palace when I came away. But Tydeus my father I scarce remember, since I was a little child when he left, when the Achaean warriors died at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThebesBoeotia">Thebes</a>. So I will be your good friend at home in Argos, and you will be mine in Lycia, should I come to visit. Let us avoid each other’s spear in the battle, there are plenty more Trojans and their worthy allies for me to slay, if a god lets my feet overtake them, and many Greeks for you to kill, if you can. Let us exchange our armour then, that those around may know that our grandfather’s friendship makes us two friends.’</p>
<p>At this, the two leapt down from their chariots, and clasped each other’s hands as a pledge of their good faith. But Zeus, the son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cronos">Cronos</a>, robbed Glaucus of his wits, for he gave Diomedes, son of Tydeus, golden armour for bronze, a hundred oxen’s worth for that of nine.</p>

<p>Now when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;reached the oak tree by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScaeanGates">Scaean</a>&nbsp;Gate, he was besieged by the Trojan wives and daughters asking after their sons and husbands, brothers and friends. He ordered them to pray to the gods, and sorrow hung about many.</p>
<p>Then he came to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>’s lovely palace, fronted by marble colonnades, and enclosing fifty chambers of polished stone, adjoining one another, where Priam’s sons slept beside their wives and opposite within the court twelve well-roofed closely-adjoining chambers of polished stone for his noble daughters and his sons-in-law. There his gracious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">mother</a>&nbsp;met him, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#LaodicePriam">Laodice</a>&nbsp;fairest of her daughters. ‘My son,’ she cried, clasping his hand, ‘why are you here and not in the midst of dreadful battle? Those vile Achaeans must be closing in on the city that you come to the Acropolis to pray to Zeus. Wait till I fetch you some sweet honeyed wine, first to pour a libation to Zeus and the other gods, and then for your relief if you will drink. Wine fortifies a man wearied by toil, as you must be wearied defending us.’</p>
<p>Mighty Hector of the gleaming helm replied: ‘No honeyed wine for me, my lady mother, lest you weaken me and I lose strength and courage. Nor should I dare to pour Zeus a libation of bright wine with unwashed hands, nor pray to the son of Cronos, lord of the thunder clouds, spattered with blood and filth. You though must gather the older women, and take burnt offerings to the temple of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;ever first to chase the spoils, and take her the best and largest robe in your palace, the one you love the most, and lay it on her knees. Vow to golden-haired Athene that you’ll sacrifice at her shrine a dozen yearling heifers, unused to the goad, and beg her to have pity on holy Ilium, and on the Trojan women and children, and bar&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;from the city, that savage spearmen, and panic-maker. Go now, to the shrine of Athene the Warrior, while I find&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a>&nbsp;and rouse him, if he will listen. Better the earth swallow him now. Zeus made him a great bane to the Trojans, to great Priam and his sons. If I saw him bound for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>’ palace, then would my heart, I say, be free of grief.’</p>

<p>At this, his mother went to the palace, calling for her maids, and they gathered the older women of the city. Meanwhile she went down to the vaulted treasure chamber where she kept her richly-worked robes, embroidered by Sidonian women, whom princely Paris had brought himself from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sidon">Sidon</a>, when he sailed the seas on that voyage that brought him high-born Helen.

She, whom Troy had appointed priestess of Athene, was daughter to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cisses">Cisseus</a>, and wife to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Antenor">Antenor</a>, the horse-tamer. They lifted their hands to Athene, with ecstatic cries, while lovely Theano took the robe, laid it on golden-haired Athene’s knees, then prayed to the daughter of Zeus. ‘Lady Athene, fairest of goddesses, protectress of the city, shatter Diomedes’ spear. Topple him headlong before the Scaean Gate, and we will sacrifice in your shrine twelve yearling heifers, unused to the goad. Take pity on the city, the Trojan women and their little ones.’ So Theano prayed, but Pallas Athene denied the prayer.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244956">Bk</span><span id="BkVI312">VI:312-368</span> Hector rouses Paris</h3>
<p>While they prayed to Almighty Zeus’ daughter,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;went to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a>’ fine home, built by the best workmen in the fertile land of Troy. They had fashioned court, hall and sleeping-chambers close to Priam’s palace and Hector’s own house on the citadel. There, Zeus-beloved Hector entered, his long spear in his hand, the spear-blade glittering before him, its socket made of gold.</p>
<p>He found Paris in his rooms busy with his splendid weapons, the shield and cuirass, and handling his curved bow. Argive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Helen">Helen</a>&nbsp;sat there too, among her ladies, superintending their fine handiwork. Catching sight of Paris, Hector rebuked him with scornful words: ‘It is wrong to be so perverse, nursing anger in your heart, while your friends die at the gates of the city and high on the battlements, yet you are the reason the sounds of war echo through Troy. You yourself would reproach those you found shirking the field of battle, so rouse yourself, before flames consume the city!’</p>
<p>Paris replied: ‘Hector, since you are right and just in your rebuke, I will explain. Listen and reflect. I don’t take to my room through anger against the Trojans, or indignation, but rather in sorrow. Indeed but now my wife sought to change my mind with gentle words, urging me to fight: and I myself agree it might be best, since victory shifts from one man to another. So wait a moment while I don my gear, or you go on ahead and I’ll follow, and overtake you.’</p>
<p>To this Hector of the gleaming helm made no answer, but Helen spoke to him in gentle tones: ‘Brother, I am indeed that wicked she-dog whom all abhor. I wish that on the day of my birth, some vile blast of wind had blown me to the mountains, or into the waves of the echoing sea, where the waters would have drowned me, and none of this would have come about. But since the gods ordained this fate, I wish that I had a better man for husband, who felt the reproaches and contempt of his fellow men. But this man of mine is fickle, and ever will be so, and will reap the harvest of it hereafter. But enter, now and be seated, my brother, since you are the most troubled in mind of all, through my shamelessness and Paris’ folly. Zeus has brought an evil fate upon us, and in days to come we shall be a song for those yet unborn.’</p>
<p>‘No, I shall not sit here, Helen,’ Hector of the gleaming helm replied: ‘kind though you are, you’ll not persuade me. Already my heart burns to aid our Trojans who miss me greatly when I’m gone. But urge your man to follow swiftly, so he overtakes me in the city. I go now to see my wife, my little boy, my people, not knowing if I shall see them again, or whether the gods have doomed me to die at Achaean hands.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244957">Bk</span><span id="BkVI369">VI:369-439</span> Hector speaks with Andromache</h3>
<p>With this,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;of the gleaming helm departed for his fine house, but failed to find white-armed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Andromache">Andromache</a>&nbsp;at home. She had gone with her son and a fair companion, to the battlements, where she stood in tears and sorrow. Failing to find his peerless wife, Hector stood at the threshold and spoke to her servants: ‘Tell me, you maids, where is white-armed Andromache? Is she visiting one of my sisters, or my noble brothers’ fair wives, or has she gone to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>’s shrine, where the rest of Troy’s noble women seek to influence the dread goddess?’</p>
<p>‘Hector,’ a busy housemaid replied, ‘if you wish to know the truth, she has done none of those things, but hearing our men were hard pressed, and the Greeks had won a great victory, she rushed to the battlements, in great distress, and the nurse followed carrying your son.’</p>
<p>At this, Hector sped from the house and retraced his path through the broad streets. When, after crossing the city, he reached the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScaeanGates">Scaean</a>&nbsp;Gate by which he intended to leave, his wife came running to meet him. Richly-dowered, Andromache was the daughter of brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EetionAndromache">Eëtion</a>, who lived in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThebesMysia">Thebe</a>&nbsp;below wooded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Placus">Placus</a>, and ruled the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cilicians">Cilicians</a>. Now she ran to her bronze-clad husband, and the nurse was with her, holding a little boy in her arms, a baby son, Hector’s bright star. Hector called him&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScamandriusAstyanax">Scamandrius</a>, but the rest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Astyanax">Astyanax</a>, since, to them, Hector alone protected Ilium. Hector smiled, and gazed at his son in silence, but Andromache crept weeping to his side, and clasped his hand, saying: ‘Husband, this courage of yours dooms you. You show no pity for your little son or your wretched wife, whom you’ll soon make a widow. The Achaeans must soon join arms against you, and destroy you. If I lose you I were better dead, for should you meet your fate, there will be no more joy for me only sorrow. I have no royal father or mother. Achilles killed my noble father when he sacked Cicilian Thebe, that many-peopled city with its high gates. But he shrank from despoiling Eëtion though he slew him, sending him to the pyre in his ornate armour, and heaping a mound above him, round which the mountain-nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus, planted elm trees. And seven brothers of mine, swift-footed mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;sent to Hades, all on a day, killing them there among their shambling-gaited cattle and white fleecy sheep. My mother, queen below wooded Placus, he dragged here with the rest of his spoils, but freed her for a princely ransom, only for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Artemis">Artemis</a>&nbsp;of the bow to slay her in her father’s house. Hector you are parent, brother, husband to me. Take pity on me now, and stay here on the battlements, don’t make your son an orphan your wife a widow. Station your men above the fig-tree there, where the wall’s most easily scaled, and the city lies then wide open. Thrice their best men led by the two&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Aiantes</a>, great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Idomeneus">Idomeneus</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Atreidae</a>, and brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, have tested the wall there. Someone skilled in divining has told them, or maybe their own experience urges them to try.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244958">Bk</span><span id="BkVI440">VI:440-493</span> Hector takes leave of his wife and son</h3>
<p>‘Lady,’ said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;of the gleaming helm, ‘I too am concerned, but if I hid from the fighting like a coward, I would be shamed before all the Trojans and their wives in their trailing robes. Nor is it my instinct, since I have striven ever to excel always in the vanguard of the battle, seeking to win great glory for my father and myself. And deep in my heart I know the day is coming when sacred&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ilium">Ilium</a>&nbsp;will fall,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>, and his people of the ashen spear. But the thought of the sad fate to come, not even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>’s or Priam’s, nor my many noble brothers’ who will bite the dust at the hands of their foes, not even that sorrow moves me as does the thought of your grief when some bronze-clad Greek drags you away weeping, robbing you of your freedom. Perhaps in Argos you’ll toil at the loom at some other woman’s whim, or bear water all unwillingly from some spring,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Messeis">Messeïs</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hypereia">Hypereia</a>, bowed down by the yoke of necessity. Seeing your tears, they will say: ‘There goes the wife of Hector, foremost of all the horse-taming Trojans, when the battle raged at Troy.’ And you will sorrow afresh at those words, lacking a man like me to save you from bondage. May I be dead, and the earth piled above me, before I hear your cries as they drag you away.’</p>
<p>With this, glorious Hector held out his arms to take his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Astyanax">son</a>, but the child, alarmed at sight of his father, shrank back with a cry on his fair nurse’s breast, fearing the helmet’s bronze and the horsehair crest nodding darkly at him. His father and mother smiled, and glorious Hector doffed the shining helmet at once and laid it on the ground. Then he kissed his beloved son, dandled him in his arms, and prayed aloud: ‘Zeus, and all you gods, grant that this boy like me may be foremost among the Trojans, as mighty in strength, and a powerful leader of Ilium. And some day may they say of him, as he returns from war, “He’s a better man than his father”, and may he bear home the blood-stained armour of those he has slain, so his mother’s heart may rejoice.’</p>

<p>With this he placed the child in his dear wife’s arms, and she took him to her fragrant breast, smiling through her tears. Her husband was touched with pity at this, and stroked her with his hand, saying: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Andromache">Andromache</a>, dear wife, don’t grieve for me too deeply yet. None will send me to Hades before my time: though no man, noble or humble, once born can escape his fate. Go home, and attend to your tasks, the loom and spindle, and see the maids work hard. War is a man’s concern, the business of every man in Ilium, and mine above all.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244959">Bk</span><span id="BkVI494">VI:494-529</span> Hector and Paris go to fight</h3>
<p>So saying, glorious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;took up his helmet with its horse-hair crest, while his wife returned home, weeping profusely with many a backward glance.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Andromache">She</a>&nbsp;soon came to man-killing Hector’s fine palace, gathered her crowd of women, and roused them to lamentation. Thus they mourned for Hector while he still lived, believing he could not escape an Achaean attack in strength, and return alive from the battlefield.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a>&nbsp;meanwhile did not linger long in his high house, but donned his fine armour with bronze trappings, and fleet of foot sped surely through the city. Like a stable-fed stallion, who has had his fill, and breaks the halter and gallops over the fields in triumph, to bathe in the lovely river as is his wont, tossing his head while his mane streams over his shoulders, glorying in his power as his strong legs carry him to the pastures, the haunts of mares; so Paris, son of Priam, strode swiftly down from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pergamus">Pergamus</a>, glittering in his armour like the shining sun, and filled with joy.</p>
<p>He soon overtook his brother, noble Hector, about to leave the place where he’d talked with his wife. Godlike Paris was first to speak: ‘Brother, I fear my long delay has kept you waiting: I failed to arrive as you requested.’</p>
<p>Hector of the gleaming helm answered him: ‘Perverse man, no one with reason would decry your martial efforts, since you have courage; but you malinger when it suits, and shun the fight. It grieves me when I hear reproaches against you on Trojan lips, you who caused them all this trouble. Go on, we will be reconciled later, if Zeus grants that we drive the bronze-greaved Greeks from the soil of Troy, and we make a free libation in the palace, to the heavenly gods who live forever.’</p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245101">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII1">VIII:1-52</span> Zeus warns the gods not to join in the battle</h3>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eos">Dawn</a>&nbsp;prepared to spread her saffron mantle over the land,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;the Thunderer gathered the gods to the highest peak of many-ridged Olympus, and spoke to them while all listened: ‘Hear me, gods and goddesses, while I say what my heart prompts. Let none of you try to defy me: all must assent, so I may swiftly achieve my aim. Whomever I find inclined to help the Greeks or Trojans, shall suffer the lightning stroke and be sent back ignominiously to Olympus, or be seized and hurled into dark&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, into the furthest, deepest gulf beneath the earth, with iron gates and threshold of bronze, as far below&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>&nbsp;as earth is from heaven. Then you will see how much mightier I am than you immortals. Go on: attempt it, and see. If you tied a chain of gold to the sky, and all of you, gods and goddesses, took hold, you could not drag Zeus the High Counsellor to earth with all your efforts. But if I determined to pull with a will, I could haul up land and sea then loop the chain round a peak of Olympus, and leave them dangling in space. By that much am I greater than gods and men.’</p>

<p>‘The Gods gather’ - Workshop of Bernard Picart, 1710</p>
<p>They all fell silent as he spoke, astonished by the force of his words. But at last a goddess, bright-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>, answered: ‘Our Father, son of Cronos, Lord over all, we all know your irresistible power, yet none the less we pity the Greek spearmen, doomed to die and fulfil their sad fate. We will hold back from battle, as you order; but we will still offer them our good advice, so they may not all suffer your wrath.’</p>
<p>Then Zeus the Cloud-gatherer smiled and said: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tritogeneia">Tritogeneia</a>, dear child, be reassured. I did not mean to threaten you, I shall be kind.’</p>
<p>With this, he harnessed his bronze-hoofed horses to his chariot, swift of flight they were with flowing manes of gold, and clothed in gold himself he grasped a fine golden whip, mounted the chariot, and started the team with a flick of his whip. The willing pair flew off on a course midway between earth and the starry heavens. To&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ida">Ida</a>&nbsp;he came with her many springs, mother of wild creatures, and to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Gargarus">Gargarus</a> the peak, site of his precinct and its fragrant altar. There the father of men and gods reined in his horses, loosed them, and cloaked them with deep mist, then seated himself on the heights, exulting in his glory, looking down on the city of Troy and the Greek ships.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245102">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII53">VIII:53-111</span> Nestor defends the Greeks</h3>
<p>Meanwhile the long-haired Achaeans ate a hasty meal in their huts then armed themselves. So, the Trojans armed themselves in their city: they being fewer, yet driven to fight, to defend their wives and children. Their gates were all thrown open, and with a great din the soldiers and chariots poured out.</p>
<p>So the two armies converged, with a clash of shields and spears, and bronze-clad warriors, the shield-bosses striking each other, and a great roar rose. Then the groans of the slain and the slayers’ cries of triumph sounded together, and the earth ran with blood.</p>
<p>All morning, while the sacred light of day grew stronger, volleys of missiles from either side reached their mark, and warriors died. But when the sun had reached the zenith, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Father</a>&nbsp;took his golden scales, and placing mortal fates in either pan, one for the horse-taming Trojans, one for the bronze-clad Greeks, grasping the balance, raised it by the middle. Down it sank on the Achaean side, spelling doom for them. Their pan settled on the fertile earth, while the Trojans’ rose towards the wide heavens. Then Zeus himself thundered aloud from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ida">Ida</a>, and sent a lightning bolt through the Greek army. Seeing it, they were dumbfounded, and terror seized them all.</p>
<p>Then none dared linger there, not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Idomeneus">Idomeneus</a>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, nor the two warrior&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Aiantes</a>, only Gerenian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a>, defender of the Greeks, and he not willingly, but because his horse was wounded. Fair Helen’s husband, noble Paris, had struck it with an arrow on the crown of the skull from which the mane springs: the deadliest spot. As the arrow pierced its brain the horse reared up in agony, writhing at the blow, throwing the chariot and team into confusion. The old man leapt down and was slashing at the traces, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s swift team sped towards him through the turmoil, bearing that brave charioteer. And now old Nestor would have lost his life, had not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;of the loud war-cry seen them, He called to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>, with a dreadful cry, to urge him forward: ‘Wily Odysseus, Zeus-born son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Laertes">Laertes</a>, where are you off to with your shield at your back, like a coward in the crowd? Mind no one plants a spear in your back as you run. Now hold your ground, so we may keep this wild man from old Nestor.’</p>
<p>He called, but noble long-enduring Odysseus failed to hear, as he ran for the hollow ships of the Achaeans. Then Diomedes, though alone, drove to the front, and standing before old Nestor’s horses, called to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Neleus">Neleus</a>’ son with winged words: ‘It seems, my lord, these young warriors prove too much for you; your strength’s lessened by sad old age that weighs on you. Your squire is too weak; your horses are too slow. Come, mount my chariot, and see what the horses of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#TrosErichtonius">Tros</a>&nbsp;can do, bred to cover the ground quickly in flight or in pursuit. I took them from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, these causers of havoc. Let our two squires take your horses, while you and I drive my pair against the horse-taming Trojans, so Hector too can see my spear quivering in my hands.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245103">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII112">VIII:112-156</span> Nestor and Diomedes fight alongside</h3>
<p>Nestor the Gerenian horseman was quick to agree. So the two squires, brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#SthenelusCapaneus">Sthenelus</a>&nbsp;and gentle&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EurymedonNestor">Eurymedon</a>, took over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a>’s mares, while he and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;mounted the latter’s chariot. Nestor grasped the gleaming reins, and whipped on the horses. They soon were within range of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, and Diomedes let fly at him as he charged towards them, striking instead his charioteer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eniopeus">Eniopeus</a>, son of brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thebaeus">Thebaeus</a>, as he gripped the reins, in his chest beside the nipple. He fell from the chariot, forcing the galloping horses to swerve, his strength faded, and his spirit was loosed.</p>
<p>Hector’s mind was darkened by dreadful sorrow for his comrade’s death. Yet he left him there, despite his grief, and sought another brave charioteer; nor was his team long lacking a master, since he soon found bold&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Archeptolemus">Archeptolemus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iphitus">Iphitus</a>’ son, and having him mount behind the swift-footed pair, threw him the reins.</p>
<p>Now irrevocable ruin faced the Trojans, and they would have been penned like sheep in Ilium, had not the father of gods and men soon noticed. With a clap of thunder, he let fly a dazzling lightning bolt, and guided it to earth in front of Diomedes’ team. A dreadful reek and flame of burning sulphur rose, and the pair, seized with terror, shied against the chariot. Then the gleaming reins fell from Nestor’s hands, and seized with terror he turned to Diomedes: ‘Turn back now, son of Tydeus, wheel your team in flight. Do you not see that Zeus denies you victory? Today the son of Cronos grants this man glory, later he will grant it us, if he so wills. But no man, however brave, can run counter to the will of almighty Zeus.’</p>
<p>‘Indeed, my aged lord, you speak true,’ said Diomedes of the loud war-cry in answer, ‘but it grieves my heart and mind to think of Hector, saying one day, in their gathering of Trojans: “Diomedes fled before me, and was first to reach the ships.” So he will brag one day, and on that day let the gaping earth swallow me.’</p>
<p>Gerenian Nestor replied: ‘What now, son of fierce Tydeus, what is this? Let Hector call you coward and weakling; the Trojans, the Dardanians will not believe it; for certain the proud Trojan shields-men’s wives will not, whose strong husbands you’ve left in the dust.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245104">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII157">VIII:157-211</span> Hera and Poseidon debate the battle</h3>
<p>So saying, he wheeled the horses and turned back through the rout, while Hector and the Trojans, with a roar, followed them with a hail of deadly missiles. Behind them, great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;of the gleaming helm raised a cry of triumph: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, those Danaan horsemen who gave you the seat of honour at their feasts, the best cuts, and endless wine, will scorn you now. You prove a woman after all, it seems. Away with you, pale puppet! No weakness here will open our wall for you, to carry away our women in your ships: you’ll see Hades first.’</p>
<p>At his taunt, Diomedes had half a mind to turn again, and fight him face to face. Three times his mind wavered, while from Mount&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ida">Ida</a>&nbsp;three times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;the Counsellor thundered, as a sign to the Trojans to press home their triumph. Hector too shouted aloud, calling to his Trojans: ‘Trojans, Lycians, Dardanians who love close combat, be men, my friends, and rouse your furious valour. I hear the son of Cronos willingly grant me victory and great glory, and death to the Danaans. They made this flimsy useless wall that will fall to us, and this ditch our horses can easily leap. Once we reach the hollow ships bring fire to burn their fleet, and in the smoke and panic kill the Greeks beside it.’</p>
<p>With this, he called to his horses: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#XanthusHector">Xanthus</a>, and you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PodargusHector">Podargus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aethon">Aethon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#LampusHorse">Lampus</a>&nbsp;the noble, repay me now for the honeyed wheat and the wine mixed for your pleasure, that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Andromache">Andromache</a>, daughter of brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EetionAndromache">Eëtion</a>, lavished on you, before she thought to serve me, though she is my loving wife. After them, at the gallop, let us win the shield of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a>, lauded to the skies for its solid gold, shield-bars and shield itself; and tear the ornate breastplate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>&nbsp;made from the shoulders of that horse-tamer Diomedes. Once I have those in my hands, I’d hope to make the Greeks take to their ships this very night.’</p>
<p>So he boasted, and royal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, enthroned on high Olympus, filled with such indignation her convulsions made the mountain quake. She called to mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Poseidon">Poseidon</a>: ‘Your rule is wide Earthshaker, yet not even you have pity in your heart for these doomed Danaans. Yet they ever make pleasing sacrifice to you at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Helice">Helice</a>, and at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aegae">Aegae</a>&nbsp;too, in your honour. You once wished victory for them, and if we chose, all we who back the Greeks, to restrain far-echoing Zeus and push the Trojans back, then he alone would grieve there on Ida.’</p>
<p>But the Earthshaker, deeply troubled in his mind, replied: ‘Wild words, Hera, ever reckless in your speech! I’d wish none of us to quarrel with Zeus, the son of Cronos, mightiest of us by far.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245105">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII212">VIII:212-272</span> Hera warns the Greeks and they rally</h3>
<p>While they talked, the whole space, between the ships and the wall and ditch, filled up with chariots and armed men, penned in by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, Priam’s son, peer of Ares, to whom Zeus gave the glory. He would have put the fine ships to the torch had not Queen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>&nbsp;planted the thought in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>’s mind to rally the Greeks promptly. Gripping his purple cloak with one great hand, he strode past the ships and huts of the Achaeans, and halted by the huge hull of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>’ black vessel, in the midst of the line so a shout would carry to either end, to the huts of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>, Telamon’s son, and to those of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>. They had beached their fine ships on the flanks, trusting their own strength and bravery. There he gave a ringing call, shouting aloud to the Danaans: ‘Greeks, for shame, wretched creatures only fit for parade! What now of our boasts that we are bravest, the empty boasts you shouted loud in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lemnos">Lemnos</a>, gorging yourself on the beef from straight-horned cattle, downing the brimming bowls of wine, that every one of you was match for a hundred or more Trojans! Now we’re not even match for one, Hector there, who will torch our fleet next. Was there ever a mighty king before, Father Zeus, whom you deceived like this and robbed of greater glory? Yet I swear that on my ill-fated journey to this place, in my benched ship, I never passed one of your fine altars without burning the thighs and fat of bullocks, eager to lay waste high-walled Troy. Zeus, grant me this at least: let us escape with our lives: let Trojans not triumph over Greeks like this.’</p>
<p>The Father was moved by his sorrowful prayer, and signified that the army should be saved and not destroyed, sending an eagle, greatest of winged omens, gripping a fawn, the offspring of some swift doe, in its talons. It dropped the fawn by the glorious altar of Zeus, where the Greeks offered sacrifice to him from whom all omens come. Knowing the bird was sent by Zeus, they ran at the Trojans with a better will, their minds filled with thoughts of battle.</p>
<p>None of the Greeks could boast, then, that he was swifter than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;to guide his horses across the ditch, and fight face to face. He was the first by far to kill an armoured Trojan,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AgelausTrojan">Agelaus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phradmon">Phradmon</a>’s son, who had turned his team to flee. Diomedes caught him in the back, with a spear between the shoulders, as he turned, that drove on through his chest. He fell from his chariot with a crash of armour.</p>
<p>The Atreidae, Agamemnon, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menelaus">Menelaus</a>, came on behind; the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxlesser">Aiantes</a>&nbsp;followed, full of furious courage;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Idomeneus">Idomeneus</a>, and his comrade&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Meriones">Meriones</a>, peer of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Enyalius">Enyalius</a>, killer of men; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EurypylusEuaemon">Eurypylus</a>, noble son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Euaemon">Euaemon</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Teucer">Teucer</a> came ninth, flexing his curved bow, taking his place behind the shield, of Ajax, Telamon’s son. Ajax would slide his shield aside, and Teucer would spy his chance. Sending an arrow flying through the ranks, his target would fall down dead where he stood. Then Teucer would scurry back, like a child to its mother, taking shelter again behind Ajax’s shining shield.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245106">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII273">VIII:273-334</span> Hector wounds Teucer</h3>
<p>Which of the Trojans did peerless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Teucer">Teucer</a>&nbsp;kill first?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OrsilochusTrojan">Orsilochus</a>, then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OrmenusTrojan1">Ormenus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OphelestesTrojan">Ophelestes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Daetor">Daetor</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#ChromiusTrojan">Chromius</a>, godlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycophontes">Lycophontes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amopaon">Amopaon</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polyaemon">Polyaemon</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#MelanippusTrojan1">Melanippus</a>. All, one after the other, he laid low on the fertile earth. And King&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>&nbsp;rejoiced, watching the mighty bow slice through the Trojan ranks; and he ran to his side, saying: ‘Lord Teucer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Telamon">Telamon</a>’s son, dear friend, shoot on like that and prove a salvation to the Greeks, and a credit to your father, who reared you, his bastard child, in his own house: distant though he is, bring him honour. Moreover, I swear to you, that if aegis-bearing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>, let me sack the fine citadel of Ilium, I will hand you, first after myself, an honourable prize, a tripod, a chariot with its team of horses, or a woman for your bed.’</p>
<p>‘My noble lord, Atreides,’ incomparable Teucer replied: ‘no need to urge one who is already willing. I have worked with all my might and never rested, from the moment we drove them back towards Ilium. I have watched and waited, killing them with my bow. Eight long-headed arrows I have let fly, and each has found its mark in the body of some young warrior. But here is the mad dog I cannot reach.’</p>
<p>With this he shot another arrow from the bow, aiming for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, eager to strike him. Hector he missed, but struck peerless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Gorgythion">Gorgythion</a>&nbsp;in the chest,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>’s mighty son, born of lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Castianeira">Castianeira</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aesyme">Aesyme</a>, goddess-like in form, whom Priam once married. His head, weighed down by the helmet, fell to one side, like a garden poppy heavy with seed and spring rain.</p>
<p>Then Teucer fired again at Hector, eager once more to strike him, but again he missed,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;making his arrow swerve. Yet he struck&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Archeptolemus">Archeptolemus</a>, Hector’s brave charioteer, on the chest by the nipple. He fell from the chariot, forcing the galloping horses to swerve, his strength faded, and his spirit was loosed.</p>
<p>Hector’s mind was darkened by dreadful sorrow for his comrade’s death. Yet he left him there, despite his grief, and called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cebriones">Cebriones</a>&nbsp;his brother, who was nearby, to take the reins, and he instantly obeyed. Hector himself leapt from his shining chariot with a dreadful cry, and grasping a rock in his hand ran at Teucer, his heart urging him on to the kill. Now Teucer had drawn a sharp bolt from his quiver, and laid it to the string but, as he drew, Hector of the gleaming helm struck him with the jagged stone by the shoulder where the collarbone joins the neck and chest, a fatal spot. It caught Teucer as he aimed in his eagerness, breaking the string. The hand and wrist were numbed; he sank to his knees, and remained there the bow falling from his hand. But Ajax saw his brother fall, and ran to bestride him, and protect him with his shield. Then two of their loyal comrades,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#MecisteusDechius">Mecisteus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EchiusMecisteus">Echius</a>’ son, and noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AlastorSalaminian">Alastor</a>, lifted him and carried him, groaning deeply, to the hollow ships.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245107">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII335">VIII:335-396</span> Hera and Athene arm for battle</h3>
<p>Now Olympian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;gave the Trojans fresh heart, and with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;at their head, exulting in his strength, they drove the Achaeans straight towards the deep ditch. Like a hound in full cry chasing lion or wild boar, snapping at flank and buttock, intent on every move, so Hector pressed the long-haired Achaeans, killing the stragglers as they fled in rout. When the Greeks had passed the ditch and palisade, leaving many dead at the Trojans’ hands, they halted by the ships, calling to one another, lifting their arms to the gods, and praying fervently. But there rode Hector, his eyes like those of some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Gorgon">Gorgon</a>&nbsp;or of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ares">Ares</a>, bane of mortals, wheeling his long-maned horses to and fro.</p>
<p>White-armed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>&nbsp;felt pity at the sight, and spoke at once to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>: ‘Ah, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, shall we not make one last effort to save the Greeks from destruction? They fill the cup of fate with their blood, falling before a single man’s onslaught, this Hector, son of Priam, who deals great harm, raging beyond my endurance.’</p>
<p>Bright-eyed Athene answered: ‘I too wish to see him, strength and courage drained, slain by the Argives on his native soil, but my father’s mind is full of evil: harsh and perverse as ever, he thwarts my desires. He forgets how I rescued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Heracles">Heracles</a>, his son, foiled time and again by the tasks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eurystheus">Eurystheus</a>&nbsp;set him. He had only to moan to Heaven, and Zeus would send me to his aid. If my heart in its wisdom had foreseen this, when Eurystheus sent him down to the House of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>, Closer of the Gate, to fetch the Hound of Hell from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Erebus">Erebus</a>, Heracles would never have re-passed the falls of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Styx">Styx</a>. But now Zeus slights me, and fulfils&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>’ wish. She kissed his knees, and brushed his chin with her fingers, and begged him to honour&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, sacker of cities. One day he will again call me his bright-eyed darling, but ready the horses for now, while I go to his palace and don my armour. Let us see if Priam’s son, Hector of the gleaming helm, is as gleeful when he sees us join the ranks. Many a Trojan now will die by the Greek ships, and glut the dogs and carrion birds, fat and flesh.’</p>
<p>White-armed Hera, the great goddess, daughter of mighty Cronos, promptly complied, readying her team with their golden harness; while Athene, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, let her soft embroidered robe, adorned by her own two hands, fall to the palace floor and donned the tunic and armour of Cloud-gathering Zeus for the sad work of war. Then she mounted the fiery chariot, gripping the long, stout, heavy spear, with which she breaks the warrior ranks, when that daughter of the mighty Father is angered. Hera now flicked the horses with her whip, and of their own accord the Gates of Heaven groaned open on their hinges, those gates the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Horae">Hours</a> keep, the Guardians of the Heavens and Olympus, who roll the heavy cloud across them or away. Through the gates, the goddesses then drove their willing team.</p>

Tell them what I say, and would surely do. I’d hamstring the horses that pull their chariot, hurl them from it, and shatter it to pieces. Not in ten years’ circuit would they be healed of the wounds my thunderbolt deals. That would show the bright-eyed goddess what a fight with her father means! I’ve less words of wrath or indignation to waste on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>: she habitually defies my decrees.’</p>
<p></p>

<p>‘Zeus turns back the goddesses’ - Crispijn van de Passe (I), 1613</p>
<p>At this, Iris, swift as the storm, sped on her way, from the peak of Ida to high Olympus, where she met them at the very gates of that many-ridged mountain, and gave them Zeus’ message: ‘Where are you rushing to, your hearts pounding in your breasts? Zeus forbids you to help the Argives. He threatens you, and he fulfils his threats. He’d hamstring the horses that pull your chariot, hurl you from it, and shatter it to pieces. Not in ten years’ circuit would you be healed of the wounds his thunderbolt deals. That would show you, bright-eyed goddess, what a fight with your father means! He has less words of wrath or indignation to waste on Hera: who habitually defies his decrees. But you’d be dreadful in your brazen impudence, if you truly dared to raise your great spear against Zeus.’</p>
<p>With these words, fleet-footed Iris took her divine way, while Hera turned to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;in alarm: ‘Well now, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, I cannot sanction us waging war on Zeus for these mortals. Let events decide who lives and who dies. Zeus must decide between the Greeks and Trojans, as is only right.’</p>
<p>So saying, she wheeled her team and returned. Then the Hours unyoked the long-maned horses, and tethered them by their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the bright entrance-wall, while the two anxious goddesses sat down, with the other gods, on golden chairs.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245109">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII438">VIII:438-488</span> Zeus prophesies the course of the war</h3>
<p>Meanwhile Father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;drove his fine chariot and team from Ida to Olympus, to the concourse of the gods.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Poseidon">Poseidon</a>, the Earth-shaker, unyoked his horses and rolled the chariot onto its stand, and covered it with a cloth. Then far-sounding Zeus sat down on his golden throne, and Olympus shook, under his feet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>&nbsp;alone sat far from Zeus, and said not a word, asked no question of him. But he knew their thoughts, and said: ‘Why so troubled, you two? Tired already of destroying Trojans on the field of glory, those Trojans you resent so deeply? Such is the strength in my unconquerable hands, that all the gods of Olympus could not turn me, come what may, while trembling seized your lovely limbs before you even saw the battlefield and its terrors. But I tell you, and this is sure, that struck by my thunderbolt you would have needed someone else’s chariot to get back to Olympus, where we immortals dwell!’</p>
<p>While he spoke, Athene and Hera sat muttering and planning evil to the Trojans. Though Athene kept quiet and held her tongue, furious as she was, consumed by anger at Father Zeus, Hera burst out in rage: ‘Dread son of Cronos what are you saying? We know your strength is that of no weakling, yet we cannot but pity the Danaan spearmen who are doomed to die a wretched death. We will hold back from battle, if you so order; but we will still offer them our good advice, so they may not all suffer your wrath.’</p>
<p>To this Zeus the Cloud-gatherer replied: ‘Look at dawn, if you wish, my ox-eyed Queen, and see this almighty son of Cronos wreak worse destruction on the vast Argive force; for mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;will not retreat until fleet-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, is roused from his hut to action, on the day when the Greeks, in desperate straits, fight at their ships’ sterns for the body of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>. So it is decreed. I care nothing for your anger. Travel the bottomless depths of earth and sea, plumb deep&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, view&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cronos">Cronos</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iapetus">Iapetus</a>&nbsp;sitting there, deprived of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hyperion">Hyperion</a>’s sunny beams, without even a breeze. Wherever you go I care nothing for your fury, you, most shameless of all.’</p>
<p>At this, white-armed Hera fell silent. And now the bright flame of the sun fell into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Ocean">Ocean</a>, and cloaked the face of fertile earth with night’s blackness. The Trojans were unwilling to see day end, but three times prayed for and welcome was dark night to the Greeks.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239245110">Bk</span><span id="BkVIII489">VIII:489-565</span> The Trojans camp in the plain</h3>
<p>Then glorious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;gathered the Trojans together, leading them from the ships to a stretch of open ground, clear of dead, beside the eddying river. They leapt from their chariots to hear what Zeus-beloved Hector had to say. He held a long spear in his hand, its bronze point gleaming, and the shaft at the top ringed with gold. Leaning on the spear he addressed the troops: ‘Trojans, Dardanians, and our allies, listen: I thought to destroy the Achaeans and their ships, before ever I saw windy Troy again; but darkness fell too soon, saving the Greeks and their stranded ships. Now we must yield to night’s blackness, and eat. Loose your long-maned horses from the chariots, and give them fodder. Then bring cattle and fine sheep from the city, bread and honeyed wine from your houses, and gather wood in plenty, so we may keep fires burning all night till early dawn, lighting the whole sky, lest the long-haired Greeks, despite the dark, make a dash for safety on the open sea. They must not take ship without a fight; if they do, give as many as you can a wound as they board, from some arrow or sharp spear, to ponder on back home, so others may think twice before they make grievous war on horse-taming Trojans. And in the city let the heralds, beloved of Zeus, call out the youths and grey-haired older men to man our battlements built by the gods, while the women keep a great fire burning in each house. And mount close watch, lest the enemy penetrate the city in our absence.</p>
<p>Perform this, brave Trojans, as I order. It is good sound counsel, enough for now. I will speak to you, horse-tamers, again at dawn. I pray to Zeus and all the gods, with high hopes that I’ll drive away these dogs brought here on their black ships by the Fates. Guard yourselves tonight, and at dawn we’ll arm and mount a fierce attack on the hollow ships. Let us see whether mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, Tydeus’ son, can drive me back from their ships to the wall, or whether I shall slay him with my bronze blade, and carry away the blood-stained spoils. In the morning he’ll find if he is brave enough to face my spear. I hope to see him lying dead in the front rank among his comrades, struck by a spear at sunrise. I wish that ageless immortality and honour, such as Athene and Apollo share, were as certain for me as that this day will bring ruin on the Greeks.’</p>
<p>The Trojans acclaimed his speech with shouts. Each unyoked their team, and tethered the horses with leather thongs. They soon brought cattle and fine sheep from the city, bread and honeyed wine from their homes, and gathered ample wood. Then the savour of roast meat wafted from earth to heaven.</p>
<p>So, with spirits high, all night long they sat in their lines of war, beside the many fires. And just as the stars shine bright in windless air, about the gleaming moon, and every mountain peak and glade and high headland stands out clear, and the skies reveal their infinite depths, displaying all the stars to gladden the shepherd’s heart; so, between the ships and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Scamander">Xanthus</a>’ streams, the fires the Trojans lit before Troy shone in their multitude. A thousand fires were glowing in the plain, and fifty men by each in the light of its blaze, their horses feeding on white barley and rye, waited for Dawn to mount her golden throne.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book IX</h2>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244210">Bk</span><span id="BkIX1">IX:1-</span>78 The Greeks meet in assembly</h3>
<p>So, the Trojans kept watch while the Greeks were gripped by panic that accompanies freezing fear, and all their leaders despaired. Like the teeming sea in turmoil when Northerlies and Westerlies that blow from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thrace">Thrace</a>&nbsp;suddenly rise, piling the dark waves swiftly in crests; hurling seaweed on the shore, so the hearts of the Greeks were in turmoil in their breasts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, stricken and in great distress, ordered the clear-voiced heralds to summon every man by name, and with little noise, and laboured at the same task himself. So they assembled and sat there deeply troubled, and Agamemnon rose to address them, groaning heavily, while tears ran down his face like dark spring-water streaking a sheer cliff: ‘My friends, you leaders and counsellors of the Greeks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, the mighty son of Cronos, has entangled me in sad delusion. The god is harsh, for he solemnly assured me I’d sack high-walled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ilium">Ilium</a>&nbsp;before I headed home; but now, with so many men lost, he reveals his cruel deceit, bidding me return disgraced to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Argos">Argos</a>. Such, it seems, is almighty Zeus’ pleasure, he who has toppled many a city, and will raze others yet, so great his power. So do now as I say, and all obey: fit out the ships and run for our native land; all hope of taking broad-paved Troy is gone.’</p>
<p>At his words, they all fell silent. They sat there speechless, a long time, deeply troubled, till at last&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;of the loud war-cry spoke: ‘Son of Atreus, I have the right, in this assembly, to oppose your royal folly: so refrain from anger. You decried my courage, first, to the Greeks, saying I was a coward and no warrior: the Achaeans heard it, both young and old. Yet while Zeus, the son of cunning Cronos, endowed you with the sceptre, so you might be honoured above all, he withheld his second gift, of courage, which is the greater source of power. Perverse king, do you truly think the Greeks such cowards and weaklings as you claim? If in your own heart you seek home, go, since the way is clear, your ships are on the shore, the whole fleet that followed you from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Mycenae">Mycenae</a>. But we other long-haired Achaeans will remain, till we sack Troy. Or let the rest of you run for your native land, yet&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#SthenelusCapaneus">Sthenelus</a>&nbsp;and I, we two, will fight on till we conquer Ilium, for a god brought us here.’</p>
<p>At this, a great shout rose from the Achaeans, acclaiming the speech of Diomedes, horse-tamer. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a>, the charioteer, then stood to speak: ‘Son of Tydeus, you are mightiest in a fight, and best of your generation in debate. Not one of us dare ignore or contradict you, yet there is more to say. Young you may be, enough to be my youngest son, yet you are right, and your advice to the Argive kings is wise. Let me, who am so much older, speak the rest; and none must scorn my words, not even lord Agamemnon. For a lawless man, without hearth or clan, is he who would stir up bitter strife among his own people. Now we must yield to night’s darkness, and eat. Post groups of sentries along the ditch by the wall. That is the young men’s task. Agamemnon, our king, take the lead in holding a banquet for the most senior; that would be right and fitting. Your huts are full of the wine jars Achaean ships bring you, day after day, from Thrace. As king over all, hospitality is in your hands. And when all are gathered together, you must follow whoever gives the best advice. And we Greeks need the best and wisest counsel, with the enemy fires burning near our ships. Who could delight in that? What we do this night will save the army, or destroy it utterly.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244211">Bk</span><span id="BkIX79">IX:79-161</span> Nestor proposes a reconciliation</h3>
<p>They listened readily to his words, and obeyed. Armed sentries left, at the double, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a>’s son&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thrasymedes">Thrasymedes</a>; by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ascalaphus">Ascalaphus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ialmenus">Ialmenus</a>, sons of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ares">Ares</a>; by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Meriones">Meriones</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphareus">Aphareus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Deipyrus">Deipyrus</a>, and noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycomedes">Lycomedes</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Creon">Creon</a>. These were the seven leaders, and each had a hundred men with long spears. They took up position midway between the ditch and wall, and there lit fires, and every man sat down to prepare his supper.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>&nbsp;led the Greek counsellors to his hut, and had a heart-warming banquet served. They sat down to the good things served before them, and when they had satisfied hunger and thirst, aged Nestor whose advice had seemed most sound, began to expound his thoughts. With their interests at heart, he addressed the gathering: ‘Glorious Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king of men, with you my speech will start and end. You are lord of many, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;has placed the sceptre in your hands and the rule of law, so you may advise your people. It is for you, above all others, to listen and then speak, and endorse whatever any may say that will profit us, since its execution depends on you. Let me say what I deem right, and I think there can be no better course than this, which I’ve long considered and still consider best, since the day when you, Zeus-born king, angered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;and took the girl&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Briseis">Briseis</a>&nbsp;from his hut, against our inclination. I tried earnestly to dissuade you, but you were swayed by your proud heart, and showed dishonour to a great man, whom the gods themselves esteem, by taking and keeping his prize. Even at this late hour let us reflect on how we might make amends, and placate him with generous gifts and pleasing words.’</p>
<p>‘Aged sire,’ Agamemnon, king of men, replied: ‘you are not wrong in showing me my blindness, and blind I was, I cannot deny. The man Zeus loves in his heart is worth an army: see how he honours Hector now and crushes us Greeks. And since I yielded blindly to a wretched passion, I am willing to make amends and compensate Achilles handsomely. Before you all, let me name the glorious gifts I’ll grant him: seven tripods, unmarked by the flames; ten talents of gold; twenty gleaming cauldrons, and twelve strong horses, prize-winners for their speed. A man with the wealth they have won for me would not lack gold and riches. And I will gift him seven women, skilled in fine needle-craft, whom I chose as spoil for their surpassing beauty, on the day when Achilles took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lesbos">Lesbos</a>. And one shall be her whom I took from him, that daughter of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Briseus">Briseus</a>. I shall give him my solemn oath that I never took her to bed, never slept with her, as men are wont to do with women. All these things shall straight away be his; and if the gods grant we sack this great city of Priam, let him enter when we Greeks divide the spoils, and load his ship with gold and bronze, and pick the twenty loveliest women after Argive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Helen">Helen</a>. And if we return to Achaean&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Argos">Argos</a>, finest of lands, he shall be a son to me, and I’ll honour him like my dear son&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Orestes">Orestes</a>, who is reared there among its riches. Three daughters I have too, in my noble palace,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Chrysothemis">Chrysothemis</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#LaodiceAgamemnon">Laodice</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iphianassa">Iphianassa</a>. Let him lead whichever he wishes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>’ house, without bride-price, and I will add a dowry, greater than any man yet gave with a daughter. Seven well-populated cities he shall have:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cardamyle">Cardamyle</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Enope">Enope</a>, and grassy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hire">Hire</a>; holy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PheraeDiocles">Pherae</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Antheia">Antheia</a>&nbsp;with its deep meadows; lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aepeia">Aepeia</a>, and vine-rich&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PedasusAgamemnon">Pedasus</a>. They are all near the sea, on our far border with sandy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pylos">Pylos</a>, and the men there own great flocks and herds. They will honour him with gifts like a god, acknowledging his sceptre, and will ensure his plans prosper. All this I will do, if he forgoes his anger. Let him give way and submit to me – of all the gods is not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>, hard and unyielding, hated most by mortals for being so – for I claim sovereignty and seniority over him.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244212">Bk</span><span id="BkIX162">IX:162-221</span> The embassy to Achilles</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a>, the Gerenian horseman, replied: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, king of men, most glorious son of Atreus: the gifts you offer prince&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;are fine indeed. Let us send a swift deputation now to his hut. Let those I choose, be ready.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phoenix">Phoenix</a>, beloved of Zeus, shall take the lead, followed by mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>&nbsp;and noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>: the heralds&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OdiusGreek">Odius</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EurybatesOdysseus">Eurybates</a>&nbsp;shall go with them. But first bring water for our hands and call for holy silence, so we may pray to Zeus, the son of Cronos, and beseech his pity.’</p>
<p>All there were satisfied with his words. Heralds came to pour water over their hands, while squires, tipping the first few drops into each cup for libation, filled brimming bowls of wine for them all. When they had poured libations and sated their thirst, the envoys left Agamemnon’s hut, Gerenian Nestor gazing at each, though at Odysseus mainly, while issuing copious instructions on how to sway&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>’ peerless son.</p>
<p>So Ajax and Odysseus walked beside the echoing sea, with many a heartfelt prayer to the god, who surrounds the land and shakes it, that softening the proud heart of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeacus">Aeacus</a>’ grandson might prove an easy task. And reaching the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>’ huts and ships, they found him delighting in the clear-toned lyre, playing a finely ornamented instrument bridged with silver, part of the spoils when he razed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EetionAndromache">Eetion</a>’s city. He was singing with joy of the deeds of mighty warriors, while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, seated opposite, heard his song through in silence. The two envoys arrived, Odysseus leading, and Achilles leapt to his feet in surprise, lyre in hand, while Patroclus too quitted his seat when he saw them. Achilles greeted them, saying: ‘Welcome, dear friends indeed – your coming here speaks of some great need – angry I may be, but you two Greeks I love more than most.’</p>
<p>With this, noble Achilles led them to his hut and seated them on chairs with purple coverings, then turned to Patroclus, saying: ‘Bring a larger bowl, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menoetius">Menoetius</a>, mix a stronger drink, and give them both wine, these men I love dearly, who are here now under my roof.’</p>
<p>Patroclus hastened to obey his dear comrade. He set out a great wooden board in the firelight, laying out a sheep’s carcass and a goat’s, and the chine of a great hog, rich with fat.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a> held them, while Achilles jointed them, then cut and spitted the joints. Meanwhile godlike Patroclus stoked the fire. When it burnt down, and the flames retreated, he raked the embers, and set the spits above them resting on andirons, after sprinkling the meat with sacred salt. When it was roasted, he heaped it on platters, Patroclus bringing bread set it out on the table in fine baskets, while Achilles served each portion. Then he took a seat by the wall, opposite godlike Odysseus, and asked Patroclus, his friend, to sacrifice to the gods. Then, when burnt offerings had been thrown into the fire, they helped themselves to the good things set before them.</p>
<h3><span id="BkIX222"></span><span id="anchor_Toc239244213">Bk IX:222-306 The offer to Achilles</span></h3>
<p>When they were sated,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>&nbsp;let&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phoenix">Phoenix</a>&nbsp;know, and noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>&nbsp;seeing his nod, filled his cup with wine and drank to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>: ‘Your health, Achilles, there’s plenty of good food for us here to warm our hearts, as much as in Agamemnon’s hut. But feasting is not what occupies us, ward of Zeus, since we foresee sorrow and feel great fear. I doubt we can save the benched ships from destruction, unless you arm yourself with your great valour. The brave Trojans and their famed allies are bivouacked close to the ships and wall, around their many fires, and say they are strong enough to swoop on our black ships. And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, Son of Cronos, shows them good omens, with lightning on the right, while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;exulting in his strength, and filled with frenzy, fears neither man nor god, but trusts in that same Zeus, and rages wildly. He prays for the swift coming of bright dawn, so he can hew the ships’ ensigns from their tall sterns, and consume their hulls with fire, smoking us out, and slaughtering all the Greeks beside them. My mind is full of fear, lest the gods fulfil his threat, and we are fated to die at Troy far from the horse-pastures of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Argos">Argos</a>.</p>
<p>But up, if you will, even now, and save the sons of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achaea">Achaea</a>, whose strength the Trojan war-noise saps. Or regret it ever after, since harm once done can never be retrieved. Before too late, think how to ward this evil from the Greeks. Good friend, did not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, your father, warn you, on the day he sent you from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phthie">Phthia</a>&nbsp;to join Agamemnon: “<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>&nbsp;will empower you, my son, if they so wish. You, set a curb on your proud spirit, a gentle heart is best; avoid the quarrels that sow mischief, and the Greeks both young and old will honour you the more.” Did he not say those words that you forget? Even now it is not too late to quell this bitter anger. Should you relent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>&nbsp;offers you noble gifts. Listen and I will say what Agamemnon promises: seven tripods, unmarked by the flames; ten talents of gold; twenty gleaming cauldrons, and twelve strong horses, prize-winners for their speed. A man with the wealth they have won for him would not lack gold and riches. And he will give seven women, skilled in fine needle-craft, whom he chose as spoil for their surpassing beauty, on the day when Achilles took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lesbos">Lesbos</a>.

And if we return to Achaean Argos, finest of lands, you shall be a son to him, and he’ll honour you like his dear son&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Orestes">Orestes</a>, who is reared there among its riches. Three daughters he has too, in his noble palace,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Chrysothemis">Chrysothemis</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#LaodiceAgamemnon">Laodice</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iphianassa">Iphianassa</a>. You shall lead whichever you wish to Peleus’ house, without bride-price, and he will add a dowry, greater than any man yet gave with a daughter.

They will honour you with gifts like a god, acknowledging your sceptre, and will ensure your plans prosper.</p>
<p>He will do all this for you, if you lay aside your anger. But if your hatred of him and his gifts is too great, yet take pity at least on the army of weary Greeks, who will honour you like a god, for the great glory you must surely win in their eyes. You could kill Hector now, as he came upon you in his wild rage: he claims there is none like him among we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Danaans">Danaans</a> who sailed here.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244214">Bk</span><span id="BkIX307">IX:307-429</span> Achilles’ answer</h3>
<p>Then fleet-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;gave his answer: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>&nbsp;of the nimble wits, royal son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Laertes">Laertes</a>, I will tell you straight out how I feel, and how things must be, to save you sitting there beside me, dealing in endless talk. Hateful as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>’ Gate, to me, is the man who thinks one thing and says another. So here is my decision. Neither&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>&nbsp;nor any other Greek will change my mind, for it seems there is no gratitude for ceaseless battle with our enemies. He who fights his best and he who stays away earn the same reward, the coward and the brave man win like honour, death comes alike to the idler and to him who toils. No profit to me from my sufferings, endlessly risking my life in war. I am like the bird that brings every morsel she finds to her unfledged chicks, and goes hungry herself. I watched through many a sleepless night, and fought through many a blood-stained day, battling warriors for the sake of their women. Twelve island cities I captured by sea, and eleven throughout Troy’s fertile land, and took much fine treasure from each. All I gave to this Agamemnon, son of Atreus. He stayed behind by his swift ships, yet kept the lion’s share and gave out some tiny portion. What he gave as prizes to princes and generals they hold still, yet he takes mine from me alone of all the Greeks, he steals my woman, my heart’s darling. He can lie by her side and take his pleasure. Yet why do the Argives war with Troy? Why did Atreides gather an army and bring it here? Was it not because of fair-haired&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Helen">Helen</a>? Are the sons of Atreus the only men on earth who love their women? Every sane and decent man loves his own and cherishes her, as I loved her with all my heart, though but a captive of my spear. Since he stole the prize from my hands, and cheats me, let him not try to win me now with his offers; he’ll not sway me, I know him too well.</p>
<p>Let him look to you, Odysseus, and the rest, if he wants to save the fleet from a fiery death. In my absence I see he has done much, built a wall and dug a fine broad stake-filled trench, yet still he can’t keep out man-killing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>. As long as I fought with the Achaeans, Hector stayed close to the wall, not far from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScaeanGates">Scaean</a>&nbsp;Gate and the oak tree. He waited to fight me there in single combat, and barely escaped alive. But now, I do not wish to do battle with noble Hector. Tomorrow I sacrifice to Zeus and the other gods, then load and launch my ships. At break of dawn, if it interests you, you will see my fleet sail the teeming Hellespont, my crews straining at the oars. Then if the mighty Earth-shaker grants me a fair voyage, in three days I will reach&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phthie">Phthia</a>’s deep soil. I left great wealth behind on this ill-starred voyage, I will take back even more, gold, and red bronze, grey iron and fair women, all that was mine by lot, all except my prize that Agamemnon, son of Atreus, stole in his arrogance.</p>
<p>Tell him openly all that I say, so the rest can take umbrage when he tries to cheat some other Greek, shameless as he is. Yet not shameless enough to look me in the face! I shall neither help by my advice or effort, so utterly has he cheated me and wronged me. He will not fool me with his words again, So much for him. Let him go swiftly to perdition, since Zeus the counsellor robs him of his wits.</p>
<p>As for his gifts they are hateful in my eyes, and not worth a hair. Even if he gave ten or twenty times what he has, and raised levies elsewhere, though it were all the wealth that flows to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OrchomenusBoeotia">Orchomenus</a>, or Egyptian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThebesEgypt">Thebes</a>, where the very houses are filled with treasure, and two hundred warriors with horse and chariot sally out from its hundred gates, not if he gave me as many gifts as the grains of sand or motes of dust, could he persuade me. First he must pay me fully in kind for this shame that stings my heart.</p>

<p>‘Achilles refuses the gifts of Agamemnon’ - Workshop of Bernard Picart, 1710</p>
<p>Nor will I wed his daughter, though as lovely as golden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, as skilled in handiwork as bright-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>, not even then. Let him choose another Greek, more princely than me, who suits him better. If the gods protect me and I reach home,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>&nbsp;himself will find me a wife. There are plenty of Greek girls in Phthia and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hellas">Hellas</a>, daughters of leaders, the defenders of cities: from those I can choose a loving wife. Often my warm heart longed to wed a girl there, some fitting bride, and enjoy what aged Peleus has won. For, all the fabled peacetime wealth of populous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ilium">Ilium</a>, before we Greeks arrived, and all the treasure in rocky&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pytho">Pytho</a>, beyond Apollo’s marble threshold, is not worth life itself. Cattle and fine sheep may be taken; tripods and chestnut steeds won, but neither taking nor winning can recall a man’s spirit once the breath has left his lips. My mother, divine silver-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>, spoke the alternative fates open to me on my way to death. Remain here and fight at the siege of Troy, forgo all home-coming, yet win endless renown; or sail home to my native land, lose fame and glory, but live a long life, and be spared an early end.</p>
<p>I advise you too to sail home. There is no hope of you conquering lofty Ilium, for far-echoing Zeus holds it carefully in his hand, and its people are full of courage. Now go and, as privileged elders, give my reply to the leaders of the Greeks, so they can think out some better way to save the ships and the army with them, since the depth of my anger forces this refusal. Let&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phoenix">Phoenix</a> though remain, and spend the night here. Then, he can sail home with me and my fleet in the morning: if he wishes to that is, I shall not force him.’</p>
<h3><span id="BkIX430">Bk</span><span id="anchor_Toc239244215">IX:430-526</span> Phoenix tells his history</h3>
<p>They were all silent at his words, stunned by his stern refusal. Finally the old charioteer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phoenix">Phoenix</a>, fearing as he did for the Greek fleet, spoke tearfully: ‘If you do intend to sail, great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, so great the anger that possesses you, and refuse to save the ships from a fiery end, how can I stay alone, dear child, without you?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, that aged horseman, sent me with you, that day you went from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phthie">Phthia</a>&nbsp;to join&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>. A child you were, ignorant of war’s evils and the assembly where men find fame. That was why he made me your guardian, to teach you how to speak and act. So I could not bear to stay here without you, not though a god should take away my years and give me that strength of youth I had when I left&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hellas">Hellas</a>, land of lovely women, fleeing a quarrel with my father,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amyntor">Amyntor</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#OrmenusGreek">Ormenus</a>. He loved his fair-haired mistress, and neglected my mother his wife, who begged me to seduce her and turn her against the old man. I consented and did so, but my father soon knew, and cursed me, called on the avenging&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Erinyes">Furies</a>&nbsp;to make sure he’d never take any son of mine on his lap. And the deathless ones,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>, the Zeus of the Underworld, and dread&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Persephone">Persephone</a>, fulfilled his curse. Enraged I sought to put my father to the sword, but some god restrained me, filling me with fear of public shame, of being reviled as a parricide among Greeks. Still, I could not bear to live in my hostile father’s house, though friends and kin gathered round and begged me to stay, slaughtering fine sheep and sleek shambling cattle, roasting fat hogs over the flames, and pouring wine in plenty from the old man’s jars. Nine nights they kept watch, in turn, stoking the fires, one lit beneath the colonnade of the walled court, one in the porch in front of my bedroom doors. But in the tenth night’s darkness, I levered open the doors of my room, and leapt the courtyard fence, unseen by maids or guards. Then I fled far through wide Hellas, reaching fertile Phthia, mother of flocks, where King Peleus welcomed me, and showed me the love a father shows his beloved only son and heir, granting me wealth and a subject people, as King of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dolopians">Dolopes</a>&nbsp;on Phthia’s far border.</p>
<p>And, loving you with all my heart, I formed you as you are, divine Achilles: you would refuse to feast in the hall or eat till I set you on my knee, filling your mouth with savoury titbits, touching the cup to your lips. And, child that you were, you would spatter my chest with wine and soak my tunic. But I suffered much for you and took great trouble, believing the gods would no longer send me a son of my own. I treated you as my son, divine Achilles, in hope that you might save me from some wretched fate.</p>
<p>So, conquer your proud spirit, Achilles, and don’t be so hard-hearted. The gods themselves may be swayed, despite their greater power, excellence and honour. The erring and sinful man in supplication may turn them from their path of anger, with incense, blessed vows, libations and the smoke of sacrifice. Prayers are the daughters of almighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, wrinkled and halting they are, with downcast eyes, following in the steps of wilful Pride. But Pride is swift-footed and strong, and soon outruns them all, and scours before them over the earth bringing men down. Prayers follow on behind trying to heal the hurt. He who respects those daughters of Zeus as they pass by, they hear his prayers and bless him. But he who is stubborn and rebuffs them, they beg Zeus, son of Cronos, to overtake with Pride, so he is brought down, and made to pay in full. So, Achilles, see that you honour the daughters of Zeus, who sway all men of noble mind. If Agamemnon failed to offer you gifts or promise more, but persisted in his furious anger, I would not tell you to swallow your pride and help the Greeks, however great their need. But now he promptly offers many gifts, and promises others later, and sends these warriors, the pick of the army, dearest to you of all the Greeks, to persuade you. Do not scorn their embassy here, or their words, though none can blame you for feeling anger. For have we not heard of men of old, warriors of great renown, who were swayed by gifts and persuaded by words, when a like fury gripped them?</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244216">Bk</span><span id="BkIX527">IX:527-605</span> The story of Meleager’s anger</h3>
<p>Let me tell you, my friends, of one I recall, and of deeds of the past, the distant past. Once, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Curetes">Curetes</a>&nbsp;were fighting the stubborn&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aetolia">Aetolians</a>, with heavy losses on either side. The Aetolians were defending&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Calydon">Calydon</a>’s lovely city, the Curetes eager to capture and sack it, all because&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Artemis">Artemis</a>&nbsp;of the Golden Throne, angered that King&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Oeneus">Oeneus</a>&nbsp;had failed to offer her first fruits of his rich orchards, brought evil to Calydon. Perhaps he forgot, and failed to notice, but, fatally blind, he sacrificed to the other gods and neglected that great daughter of Zeus alone. So, in her wrath, the child of Zeus and goddess of the hunt sent a fierce white-tusked wild boar against him, to waste his orchards, far and wide. It uprooted the trees and leveled them, branch and blossom.</p>
<p>It was Meleager who gathered huntsmen and hounds from a host of cities and killed the boar, so huge that it needed a mighty force to hunt it down, and not before many a man met his end. Yet even then the goddess stirred a quarrel over the shaggy carcass, between the Curetes, his uncles, and the brave Aetolians, regarding the head and hide.</p>
<p>As long as Meleager, beloved of Ares, was in the field, so long the Curetes suffered, and though they came in force were driven back from the walls. But when the anger that clouds the mind of men, even the wise, filled Meleager, a deep anger caused by his beloved mother,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Althaea">Althaea</a>, he lay at home idle beside his wife. She was the lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a>, child of slim-ankled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Marpessa">Marpessa</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EvenusMarpessa">Evenus</a>’ child, and of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Idas">Idas</a>, the mightiest man on the face of the earth in those days, who raised his bow against Phoebus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;to keep Marpessa for his own. Her father and mother called Cleopatra, Alcyone, because the mother had mourned like the kingfisher with its plaintive call, when far-darting Apollo had snatched her child. Meleager lay there, nursing his anger, embittered by his mother’s curse. For he had killed an uncle, her brother, and she had knelt and beat on the fertile earth with her fists, and drowned her breast with tears, and called on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>&nbsp;and dread&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Persephone">Persephone</a>&nbsp;to destroy her son. And the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Erinyes">Fury</a>&nbsp;that walks in the darkness of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Erebus">Erebus</a>&nbsp;heard her, she of the pitiless heart.</p>
<p>The noise of the enemy soon reached the city gates. They were battering at the walls. So the Aetolian Elders sent their leading priests to beg Meleager’s help, promising him a mighty gift, the choice of fifty acres, half vineyard and half open farmland, from the fertile heart of the fair Calydonian plain. And the aged charioteer, King Oeneus, standing at the threshold of Meleager’s tall chamber, rattling the solid doors, beseeched his son, as his mother and sisters did too, though their strong pleas annoyed Meleager even more. Not even his dearest, most loyal friends could sway his heart. At last, when the Curetes were scaling the walls and setting fire to the great city, and his very room was under siege, his lovely wife beseeched him in tears, picturing all the suffering that comes to those whose city falls; the slaughter of the men, the houses wasted by fire, the fair women and children taken by strangers. Her list of evils stirred his heart, and he ran to don his shining armour. So, yielding to his conscience, he saved the Aetolians from disaster, though they gave him none of the gifts they had offered, despite their being saved.</p>
<p>Dear child, don’t be like-minded, or be led astray by a god. It will be harder work saving the ships once they are in flames. Stir yourself while gifts may be had and the Greeks will honour you like a god. Re-enter the war when the offer is gone, and though you may turn the tide of battle, they will show you far less honour.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244217">Bk</span><span id="BkIX606">IX:606-655</span> Achilles remains adamant</h3>
<p>Swift-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;replied: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phoenix">Phoenix</a>, my father, my aged lord, beloved of Zeus, I have no need of such honour. I am honoured by what Zeus ordains for me, to stay by the beaked ships while there is breath in my body, and life in my limbs. And I tell you this, and take it to heart: do not try to sway my mind with shows of grief, on behalf of that warrior son of Atreus. Take care not to love him, and so incur my hatred, I who love you: better for me if you anger him who angers me. Share my kingdom and my honour, and let these men carry my answer, while you rest here on a soft bed. At dawn we will decide whether to go or stay.’</p>
<p>With this he signaled to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, with a nod of his head, to spread a comfortable bed for Phoenix, so the others might take the hint and leave the hut.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>, godlike son of Telamon, then spoke: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>&nbsp;of many wiles, Zeus-born son of Laertes, we should go, since we achieve nothing by staying here. We must hasten to give the news to the Greeks, who no doubt await us, bad though it is. Achilles’ proud heart has raised him to such a pitch of fury he forgets, harsh man that he is, his comrades’ love, with which we in the fleet honoured him above all others. He shows no pity! Yet a man accepts blood-money even from his brother’s or his son’s killer, and the killer is not expelled from the land if he pays the price to the next of kin, whose pride and feelings are appeased by such compensation. Achilles, the gods have hardened and poisoned your heart, all because of a girl, while we offer you seven, the best there are by far, and a host of gifts besides. So be gracious and show respect for your house, since we represent the Danaans here, and are keen to remain your closest and dearest friends of all the Achaeans.’</p>
<p>Swift-footed Achilles quickly replied: ‘Zeus-born Ajax, son of Telamon, what you last said my own heart echoes, yet it swells with anger when I recall how the son of Atreus shamed me before the Argives, as though I were some wanderer without rights. You must go and give my answer. I will think no more of war and bloodshed, till noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, Priam’s warrior son, comes here slaughtering Greeks and setting the fleet aflame, and reaches the huts and ships of my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>. Only here, by my hut, by my black ship, will Hector be stopped, however inspired he is in battle.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239244218">Bk</span><span id="BkIX656">IX:656-713</span> The embassy returns</h3>
<p>At this, each guest took a two-handled cup and offered a libation then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>&nbsp;led the way back along the lines. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;told his men and maidservants to spread a soft bed for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phoenix">Phoenix</a>, swiftly, which they did, covering it with fleeces and rug and linen sheets. There the old man lay and waited for morning light. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;slept in the innermost part of the sturdy hut, with a woman he brought from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lesbos">Lesbos</a>&nbsp;at his side, lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomede">Diomede</a>, daughter of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PhorbasLesbos">Phorbas</a>. And Patroclus lay opposite, with fair&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iphis">Iphis</a>, whom noble Achilles assigned to him at the taking of lofty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Scyrus">Scyrus</a>, city of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Enyeus">Enyeus</a>.</p>
<p>Now, when the envoys returned to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>’s hut, the Achaean lords sprang to their feet and drank a toast to them from golden cups, then fired questions at them. The king was foremost: ‘Praiseworthy Odysseus, glory of the Greeks: tell me quickly. Does he choose to defend the ships from fire, or does he refuse, his heart still filled with anger?</p>
<p>Then noble long-suffering Odysseus replied: ‘Glorious son of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men, the man has no thought of relenting, but fuels his anger, and wishes no part in you or your gifts. He suggests you take counsel with us Argives on how to save the Greek fleet and the army, while he threatens to launch his curved well-benched ships at dawn. He says he advises the rest to sail home, since you have no hope of conquering lofty Ilium, that far-echoing Zeus holds carefully in his hands, and whose people are full of courage. Those were his words, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>&nbsp;here and these two heralds, both sober men, can confirm them. But we left old Phoenix resting there, as Achilles commanded, to travel home to his dear land at dawn, though only if he wishes, since Achilles will not force him.’</p>
<p>At his words, all fell silent, dismayed by his forceful speech, and a gloomy silence followed, until at length&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>&nbsp;spoke, he of the loud war-cry: ‘Glorious son of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men, I wish now you had not deigned to plead with that peerless son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, nor offered him a host of gifts. He is never anything but proud, and now you encourage his pride. But we must let him be, whether he goes or stays. He will fight when his own conscience demands it, and a god rouses him. But listen and do as I say. Let us go and sleep, when our hunger and thirst are sated, since food and drink nurture strength and courage: but when rosy-fingered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eos">Dawn</a>&nbsp;glows fair, swiftly deploy the chariots and men in front of the ships, then urge them forward, fighting yourself with the foremost.’</p>
<p>All the leaders expressed their approval of his words, thrilled by Diomedes, tamer of horses. Then they poured libations and each went to his hut, to lie down there and enjoy the gifts of sleep.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book XVI</h2>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246125">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI1">XVI:1-100</span> Patroclus asks to fight in Achilles’ armour</h3>
<p>As they fought on around the benched ship,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, hot tears pouring down his face like a stream of dark water flowing in dusky streaks down the face of a sheer cliff, returned to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, leader of men. Noble Achilles, the fleet of foot, saw and pitied him, and spoke to him with winged words: ‘Why are you crying like a little girl, Patroclus, like a child running by her mother’s side, begging to be carried, clutching at her skirt to make her stop, and tearfully looking up until her mother takes her in her arms? Your teardrops fall like hers, Patroclus. Have you bad news for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>&nbsp;or myself, some tidings from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phthie">Phthia</a>&nbsp;known to you alone?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menoetius">Menoetius</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#ActorMenoetius">Actor</a>’s son and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>&nbsp;son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeacus">Aeacus</a>, our fathers, are both still alive, men say, Peleus among his Myrmidons. Their death indeed would grieve us deeply. Or do you weep for the Argives, dying by the hollow ships, because of their presumption? Say, now! Don’t keep it to yourself: let us both know.’</p>
<p>Then Patroclus, great horseman, you groaned heavily in reply: ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of the Greeks, restrain your indignation now great sorrow is come upon them. All our best men lie by the ships wounded by arrow or spear thrust:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Diomedes">Diomedes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tydeus">Tydeus</a>’ great son,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Odysseus">Odysseus</a>, the famous spearman,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>&nbsp;too, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EurypylusEuaemon">Eurypylus</a>&nbsp;with an arrow in the thigh. The healers, skilled in the use of herbs, are busy trying to cure their wounds, while you, Achilles, remain intractable. May such anger never possess me as grips you, you whose useless valour only does harm to all. How will posterity benefit, if you fail to save the Argives from ruin? Pitiless man, you are no son it seems of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>&nbsp;or the horseman Peleus, rather the grey sea and the stony cliffs bore you, with heart of granite. If in your mind perhaps some prophecy deters you, some word of Zeus your divine mother relayed, then at least let me take the field now, leading the ranks of Myrmidons, so I may be a saving light to the Danaans. And let me borrow that armour of yours, so the Trojans might take me for you and thus break off the battle. Then the warrior sons of Achaea, in their exhaustion, may win a breathing space: there are few such chances in war. We who are fresh might easily drive a weary enemy back to their city from the ships and huts.’</p>
<p>So Patroclus made his request, fool that he was, for his own doom and an evil death were the certain answer to his prayer. Fleet-footed Achilles, answered passionately: ‘Ah, Zeus-born Patroclus, what words are these! I know nothing of any prophecy, nor has my divine mother relayed any word from Zeus, my heart is simply gripped with deadly grief, because a man has chosen to rob his equal, and snatch his prize, given the power. A deadly grief: and my heart has suffered deeply. The girl the Achaeans chose for me as prize, the girl I won with my spear when I took her walled city, Lord Agamemnon snatches from my arms, as though I were some exile without rights. But let us call all that past and done. It seems my anger wasn’t fated to last forever. I said indeed it would end when the sound of battle echoed about my ships. So then, now that a dark cloud of Trojans hems in the ships so closely, and we Greeks, confined to a narrow space, have nothing left at our backs but the shore, clad your shoulders in my glorious armour, and lead my Myrmidons, who love a fight, to battle. It seems the whole of Troy attacks us fearlessly, now they can see no sign of my helm, its visor gleaming in their faces. They would soon fill the river-beds with their dead, and not be warring round our camp, if Agamemnon were but warm towards me. It is not some spear in Diomedes’ hands will save the Greeks from ruin, nor that hateful voice, I fail to hear, of Atreus’ son, shouting his head off. It is man-slaying Hector’s call that rings in my ears as he urges on his Trojans, their cries that fill the plain, and they who conquer the Greeks in battle. Yet you must take the fight to them, and save the fleet from ruin, Patroclus, for our means of escape is lost once they set fire to the ships. Listen while I give you my advice, and you can win glory for me, and recompense from these Danaans, the return of that lovely girl and fine gifts as well. When you have driven them from the ships, come back to me. Even if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>’s lord, the Thunderer, grants you glory, don’t press on against the battle-loving Trojans on your own: that will only lessen my chance of honours. In the heat of victory, as you lay about the Trojans in this fight, don’t make for Ilium, lest a god from Olympus comes to join the fray, for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, the Far-Striker, loves them greatly. Return to me, when you have lit your light of deliverance among the ships, leave the rest to drive the enemy over the plain. By Father Zeus,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;and Apollo, I wish the Trojans death to a man and the Argives likewise, and that we two might survive the ruin, to pry loose Troy’s holy diadem.’</p>

<p>‘Achilles warns Patroclus’ - Crispijn van de Passe (I), 1613</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246126">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI101">XVI:101-154</span> Patroclus arms as the ships burn</h3>
<p>As they spoke,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>&nbsp;was forced to retreat in a shower of missiles. He was conquered by Zeus’ will, and the efforts of the brave Trojans. The gleaming helm on his head rang, as its flanges took the blows time after time, and his left shoulder ached from swinging his glittering shield, though even the hail of missiles failed to beat it down. He gasped for breath, and sweat streamed from his limbs, unable to pause for rest, as savage attack followed attack from every side.</p>
<p>Tell me now,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Muse">Muses</a>, you who live on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Olympus">Olympus</a>, how the Achaean ships were first set on fire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;charged at Ajax and struck with his long sword at the ash pole near the socket at the top, shearing the head away, and leaving Telamonian Ajax brandishing a useless pike, its bronze blade clanging to the ground far away. Ajax shuddered deep in his mighty heart at the gods’ actions, and knew that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;the Thunderer, on high, intent on Trojan victory, was bringing all their battle plans to naught. So he fell back out of range, then the Trojans threw blazing brands into the swift ship, and a stream of living flame instantly engulfed it.</p>
<p>Now, as fire took the ship’s stern at last,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;struck his thigh and turned to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>: ‘Up, Zeus-born Patroclus, Master of the Horse, I see a glare of flame by the ships. They must not take them, and cut off our retreat! Arm fast as you can, and gather the men.’</p>
<p>At his words, Patroclus began to clad himself in gleaming bronze. First he clasped the shining greaves, with silver ankle-pieces, about his legs. Next he strapped Achilles’ ornate breastplate round his chest, richly worked and decorated with stars. Over his shoulder he hung the bronze sword with its silver studs, and then the great thick shield. On his strong head he set the fine horse-hair crested helm, its plume nodding menacingly. Lastly he grasped two stout spears that suited his grip, though not peerless Achilles’ own great, long, and heavy spear that alone among the Achaeans he could wield, that spear of ash from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pelion">Pelion</a>’s summit that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cheiron">Cheiron</a>&nbsp;gave to the warrior’s dear father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, for the killing of men.</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a>, whom he honoured most after Achilles, breaker of battle lines, and trusted most to keep within call in the fight, was ordered to harness the horses quickly. Automedon led Achilles’ fleet-footed pair beneath the yoke,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#XanthusAchilles">Xanthus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Balius">Balius</a>, swift as the wind, whom&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Podarge">Podarge</a>&nbsp;the Harpy, grazing a meadow beside Ocean’s Stream, conceived with the West Wind. In a side-trace too he harnessed peerless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PedasusAchilles">Pedasus</a>, whom Achilles drove off when he took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EetionImbros">Eëtion</a>’s city. Pedasus though mortal still kept pace with those immortal.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246127">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI155">XVI:155-209</span> Achilles sends out the Myrmidons</h3>
<p>Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;made his round of the huts and called all the Myrmidons to arms. They gathered like a pack of ravening wolves filled with indescribable fury, like mountain wolves that have brought down a stag with full antlers, and rend it with blood-stained jaws then go in a mass to drink, lapping the dark water with slender tongues, dripping blood and gore, the hearts in their chests beating strong and their bellies gorged. So the captains and generals of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>&nbsp;surged around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, while Achilles stood among them, marshalling charioteers and infantry.</p>
<p>Fifty were the swift ships Zeus-beloved Achilles led to Troy, with fifty men, his comrades, to man the oars. And five leaders he charged with issuing orders, he being supreme commander. The first company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#MenesthiusMyrmidon">Menesthius</a>&nbsp;led, he of the gleaming breastplate, the son of the river-god&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sperchius">Spercheus</a>. Lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polydora">Polydora</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>’ daughter, bore him, a mortal woman who lay with the ceaseless stream, but in name he was the son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#BorusPerieres">Borus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Perieres">Perieres</a>’ son, who married her freely and gave a handsome dowry.</p>
<p>The second Company warlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eudorus">Eudorus</a>&nbsp;commanded. His mother too,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polymele">Polymele</a>, a fine dancer, daughter of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phylas">Phylas</a>, bore him out of wedlock. Great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hermes">Hermes</a>, the Slayer of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Argus">Argus</a>, fell for her when she caught his eye, among the choir of girls on the dancing floor of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Artemis">Artemis</a>, goddess of golden arrows and the sounding hunt. Hermes the Helper took her swiftly to her chamber and lay with her secretly. She bore him this glorious son, Eudorus, finest of runners and fighters. But when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eileithyie">Eileithyia</a>, goddess of childbirth, brought him into the world, and at last he saw the light,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Echecles">Echecles</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#ActorMyrmidon">Actor</a>, powerful and steadfast, paid a vast bride-price and led her home. There her old father Phylas cherished and nurtured the child tenderly, loving him dearly as if he were his son.</p>
<p>Warlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PeisanderMyrmidon">Peisander</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Maemalus">Maemalus</a>, led the third company, the best spearman next to Patroclus among the Myrmidons. The old charioteer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phoenix">Phoenix</a>&nbsp;led the fourth, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Alcimedon">Alcimedon</a>&nbsp;the fifth, the peerless son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Laerces">Laerces</a>.</p>
<p>When Achilles had marshalled them, under their leaders, in their separate companies, he gave them this stern injunction: ‘Myrmidons let none forget the threats with which you menaced the Trojans, while in my wrath I kept you here by the ships. You all accused me, saying: “Harsh son of Peleus, your mother nursed you on bile, pitiless man, keeping your comrades idle here, against their will. Since your heart is filled by this wretched anger, let us take to the ships and sail home again.” That was how you reviled me in your gatherings. Well now the work of war is upon you, such as in past days at least you loved. So, let each man find his courage, and fight against these Trojans.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246128">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI210">XVI:210-256</span> Achilles prays to Zeus</h3>
<p>His words roused their bravery and their strength, and they dressed ranks more closely as their prince addressed them. Like the close-set stones in the high wall of a house, fitted tightly to defend it from the wind’s power, so their helms and bossed shields were ranked, shield to shield, helm to helm, man by man, so tightly packed that as they moved their heads, the horsehair crests on their gleaming helmet ridges touched together. Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a>, like-minded warriors, posted themselves at the head of the Myrmidons, ready to do battle.</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;left them, and went to his hut. There he opened the lid of a fine ornate chest that silver-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>&nbsp;had placed aboard his ship, filled to the top with thick wool rugs, tunics, and cloaks to keep off the wind. He kept a beautifully fashioned cup inside it, from which no other man was allowed to drink, which he used for libations to Zeus alone. He took it from the chest, cleaned it with a sulphur mix, then washed it and his hands in clear water, and filled it with red wine. Standing in the middle of the courtyard, he poured the wine on the ground, gazed at the heavens, and prayed to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;the Thunderer who listened: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pelasgus">Pelasgian</a>&nbsp;Lord Zeus, who live far off, ruler of wintry&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dodona">Dodona</a>, surrounded there by your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Selli">Elloi</a>, priests and interpreters with unwashed feet, who sleep on the ground, you who have heard me before when I prayed, who have honoured me by striking hard at the Greek army, fulfil my prayer now. I will stay here by the beached ships, but I am sending my friend with a host of Myrmidons to war. Grant him glory, far-echoing Zeus, and fill his heart with courage, so that Hector may know my companion’s skill in war, that his invincibility does not depend on my presence in the field. And when he has rid the ships of the foe and their battle-cries, let him return to the ships resplendent in my armour, he and his men unscathed by the close combat.’</p>

<p>‘Achilles honours Zeus’ - Workshop of Bernard Picart, 1710</p>
<p>So he prayed, and Zeus the Counsellor listened. One wish the Father granted, but the other he denied. Patroclus would indeed drive the enemy from the ships, ending their attack, but would not return safe from that battle.</p>
<p>When Achilles had finished the libation and his prayer to Father Zeus, he returned to his tent and shut away the cup in its chest, then took up a vantage point before his hut, keen to gaze on that fatal conflict between the Greeks and Trojans.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246129">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI257">XVI:257-350</span> Patroclus takes the field</h3>
<p>But the host of men ranked behind brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;marched out, full of confidence, to attack the Trojans, like a horde of wasps that foolish boys will stir to anger, poking the roadside nest, causing a public nuisance, since some passer-by may then rouse them unwittingly, and out they fly in a valiant swarm to defend their larvae. With the same courageous spirit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>&nbsp;flowed from the ships, and with ceaseless cries. And Patroclus shouted loudly to them all: ‘Myrmidons, warriors of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, be men, my friends, and fill your minds with furious courage, so we may win glory for the son of Peleus, greatest of the Argives beside the ships, and for his men who fight at close quarters, the pick of the army; and so the son of Atreus, imperial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, may acknowledge his great blindness in failing to honour the best of all the Greeks.’</p>
<p>With this, he put heart and strength into every man, and they launched themselves in a mass at the Trojans, so that the ships echoed to the shouts of the Achaeans. And when the Trojans saw Patroclus and his charioteer in all their shining armour, they thought swift-footed Achilles had ended his quarrel by the ships, and now was reconciled; their hearts sank, and their line began to waver, and each man looked round anxiously to find a path of escape from utter ruin.</p>
<p>Patroclus it was who hurled the first glittering spear, right into the centre of the throng milling around the stern of brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Protesilaus">Protesilaus</a>’ ship, striking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pyraechmes">Pyraechmes</a>, who had led his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paeonia">Paeonian</a>&nbsp;horse-lords from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amydon">Amydon</a>&nbsp;and the banks of the broad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Axius">Axius</a>. He found the right shoulder, and backward Pyraechmes tumbled in the dust with a loud groan, while around him his comrades fled in panic, now Patroclus had killed their leader and champion. Sweeping them from the stern, the Greeks put out the fire, leaving the half-burnt vessel behind as they drove the Trojans in rout among the hollow ships, while the cries rose up to heaven.</p>
<p>As Zeus the Lightning-Gatherer drives dense cloud from the high summit of some great mountain, such that craggy peaks and lofty headlands with all their glades spring into view, and the sky grows clear to its very depths; so the Danaans drove the cloud of smoke and flame from their ships, and breathed more freely. Yet the battle continued, for the black ships were not yet purged of the Trojans, who still showed resistance, and gave ground to the Greeks, beloved of Ares, only when they must.</p>
<p>Then the Greek leaders each killed his man as the Trojan force was scattered. Mighty Patroclus pierced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AreilycusTrojan">Areilycus</a>&nbsp;in the thigh with a throw of his spear as he turned to run, driving the point clean through, so the bronze shattered the bone and Areilycus fell face-forwards on the ground. Warlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menelaus">Menelaus</a>&nbsp;thrust at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThoasTrojan">Thoas</a>&nbsp;and hit him in the chest, where the shield failed to protect him, loosening his limbs.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Meges">Meges</a>&nbsp;was too quick for the charging&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amphiclus">Amphiclus</a>, striking through the thigh, where the muscle is densest, the spear-point tearing the sinews, and darkness shrouded his eyes.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nestor">Nestor</a>’s son,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Antilochus">Antilochus</a>, caught&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Atymnius">Atymnius</a>&nbsp;with his spear’s keen blade, driving the bronze tip through his flank so he toppled forward. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Maris">Maris</a>, nearby, angered by his brother’s death, charged at Antilochus with his spear, and straddled the corpse. Yet a second son of Nestor, godlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thrasymedes">Thrasymedes</a>, before his enemy could thrust, struck him deftly in the shoulder. The spear-blade sheared the ligaments at the base of the arm, and smashed the bone. He fell with a thud and darkness clouded his eyes. So these two brothers, vanquished by two, went down to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Erebus">Erebus</a>. Spearmen they were, noble friends of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>, sons of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amisodarus">Amisodarus</a>: he who reared the monstrous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Chimaera">Chimaera</a>&nbsp;that brought grief to many a man.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxlesser">Ajax</a>&nbsp;the Lesser, son of Oïleus, too leapt into the throng where&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cleobulus">Cleobolus</a>&nbsp;was impeded, taking him alive but swiftly ending his struggles with a blow to the neck from his sword. Its blade ran hot with blood, and over Cleobolus’ eyes fell the darkness of death and unyielding fate.</p>
<p>Next&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peneleos">Peneleos</a>&nbsp;met with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lyco">Lyco</a>, after their spear throws failed, both hurling them in vain, now clashing instead with swords. Lyco swung at the helmet ridge with its horsehair crest, shattering his sword at the hilt. But Peneleos struck at the neck beneath the ear, and the blade sliced through, leaving the head hanging to one side, held only by a piece of skin, as Lyco fell.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Meriones">Meriones</a>, running swiftly, overtook&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AcamasAntenor">Acamas</a>, wounding him in the right shoulder as he mounted his chariot. He fell to the ground and a mist veiled his eyes.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Idomeneus">Idomeneus</a>&nbsp;too, with the merciless bronze, thrust at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#ErymasTrojan1">Erymas</a>, struck him in the mouth so the spear passed clean through the skull, below the brain, and shattered the white bone, smashing the teeth, filling the eyes with blood. And blood spurted from nostrils and gaping mouth, as death’s black cloud enfolded him.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246130">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI351">XVI:351-425</span> Patroclus routs the Trojans</h3>
<p>So each of these Danaans killed his man, and the Greeks harried the Trojans, like hungry wolves battening on lambs or kids, snatching the young and weak from the hill-flock that some foolish shepherd allowed to scatter. The Trojans lost all heart, and took to tumultuous retreat.</p>
<p>Now mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Ajax</a>&nbsp;was keen as ever to hurl a spear at bronze-clad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, but the Trojan leader, skilled in war, his broad shoulders protected by his ox-hide shield, watched the whirring arrows and hurtling spears pass by. He knew the tide of battle was turning, but held on, anxious to save his loyal men.</p>
<p>Like a dark cloud from Olympus, when Zeus whips up a storm, that sails through the bright air to shroud the sky, so the noise of the Trojan rout spread from the ships, and they crossed the trench again in confusion. And now Hector was carried from the field, weapons and all, by his swift-footed team, leaving those trapped at the trench with no means of escape, the trench where many a pair of swift war-horses shattered the pole and left their master’s chariot behind.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, slaughter in his heart, chased them down, calling fiercely to his Danaans, while the Trojans, their lines broken, filled the ways in tumultuous flight. A cloud of dust rose to the sky, as the straining horses sped towards the city from the ships and huts. Wherever he saw knots of men fleeing, Patroclus headed them off with a cry, others falling headlong from overturned chariots beneath his axle-trees. Those swift immortal horses the gods gave as a splendid gift to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>&nbsp;charged on and leapt the trench at a bound, as Patroclus’ heart urged him on towards Hector, but the Trojan leader’s team was swift and had carried him from the field. The rushing sound of the host of Trojan horses as they fled was like the mighty roar of the raging torrents that score the hillsides, as they race from the mountains to the sea laying waste the fields, when some tempest strikes the black earth in harvest time and Zeus sends violent rain, in anger against those who deliver corrupt judgements in free assembly, careless of divine vengeance and void of all justice.</p>
<p>Patroclus had now cut off the leading companies and pushed them back towards the ships denying them a path to the city in their panic. Between the ships, the high wall, and the river, he put them to the slaughter, avenging many a dead Danaan. There he killed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pronous">Pronous</a>&nbsp;first with a throw of his bright spear, taking him in the chest exposed by his shield, and loosening his limbs so he fell with a thud. Then he rushed at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThestorEnops">Thestor</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EnopsTrojan">Enops</a>, who crouched in his gleaming chariot, his mind and senses lost, and the reins slipped from his hands. Patroclus struck him on the right of his jaw with the spear, driving it past the teeth, and pulling its shaft back dragged him over the chariot’s rim, like a man astride a jutting rock landing a mighty fish hooked on the end of his line. He hauled him from the chariot, gaping on the end of his spear then dropped him on his face as his life fled. Next, facing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Erylaus">Erylaus</a>’s attack, Patroclus hurled a rock that landed square on his head and split the skull apart in its heavy helmet so that the man fell prone on the ground, and death that devours the spirit cloaked him. Then, one after another, he left men dead on the black earth,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#ErymasTrojan2">Erymas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amphoterus">Amphoterus</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Epaltes">Epaltes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#TlepolemusDamastor">Tlepolemus</a>&nbsp;son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Damastor">Damastor</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EchiusLycian">Echius</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pyris">Pyris</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ipheus">Ipheus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Euippus">Euippus</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polymelus">Polymelus</a>&nbsp;son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Argeas">Argeas</a>.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>&nbsp;saw his belt-less&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycians</a> fall at the hands of Patroclus, he called out to the rest in reproach: ‘Shame on you, Lycians, where are you off to? Run then, quickly, while I face this fellow, and find out who it is that conquers all and hurts us so, killing so many of our noblest.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246131">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI426">XVI:426-507</span> The death of Sarpedon</h3>
<p>So saying, he leapt fully armed from his chariot, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;seeing him do so did likewise. With loud cries, they attacked each other, like raucous vultures, fighting with curved beak and crooked talon on some high crag.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, gazing down on them, felt pity, and spoke to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>&nbsp;his sister-wife: ‘Alas that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>, so dear to me, is fated to die at the hands of Patroclus! Even now I am undecided, whether to snatch him up and set him down alive in his rich land of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycia</a>, far from this sad war, or allow him to fall to this son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menoetius">Menoetius</a>.’</p>
<p>‘Dread son of Cronos,’ ox-eyed Queen Hera replied, ‘what do you mean? Are you willing to save a mortal from the pains of death, one long since doomed by fate? Do so, but don’t expect the rest of us to approve. And think hard about this fact too. If you send Sarpedon home alive, why should some other god not do the same for their dear son, and save him from the thick of war? Many who fight before Priam’s great city are children of immortals, and those divinities will resent it deeply. If he’s so dear to you, and it grieves your heart, let Patroclus defeat him in mortal combat, but after his spirit has departed, send&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thanatos">Death</a>&nbsp;and sweet&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hypnus">Sleep</a>&nbsp;to bear him away to the broad land of Lycia, where his brothers and all his kin may mark his resting place with barrow and pillar, a privilege of the dead.’</p>
<p>The Father of men and gods accepted her advice, but he sent a shower of blood-red raindrops to the earth, to honour his beloved son whom Patroclus would slay in the fertile land of Troy, far from his native realm.</p>
<p>Now, as the two warriors came face to face, Patroclus struck noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thrasymelus">Thrasymelus</a>, Sarpedon’s brave squire, piercing his lower belly, and loosening his limbs. But Sarpedon’s reply went astray, his gleaming spear striking the horse&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PedasusAchilles">Pedasus</a>&nbsp;on its right shoulder, and the horse cried out in pain breathing its last, and fell in the dust with a great sigh as it gave up its life. The other two horses pulled away, the yoke creaking with the strain, their reins entangled with the trace horse in the dust. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a>, the noted spearman, found an answer. Leaping down, and drawing the long sword from beside his sturdy thigh, he cut the trace horse loose in a moment. The other pair righted themselves, and tugged again at the harness, as the two men resumed their deadly duel.</p>
<p>Again Sarpedon’s bright spear missed, the blade passing over Patroclus’ left shoulder, leaving the man unscathed. But Patroclus hurled his bronze, in turn, and the spear sped from his hand and not in vain, striking Sarpedon where the ribs press on the beating heart. He fell as an oak, a poplar or lofty pine falls in the mountains, downed by the shipwrights with sharp axes as timbers for a ship. Down he tumbled, and lay stretched out at his horses’ feet, groaning and clutching the blood-stained dust before his chariot. There, struggling with death, the leader of the Lycian shieldmen, straddled by Patroclus, called out to his dear comrade: ‘Glaucus, my friend, warrior of warriors, now you must wield the spear and battle bravely; now if you truly have fight in you, let dread war be your aim. First go and rouse the Lycian leaders to battle now over Sarpedon. And you yourself must defend me with your spear. If the Greeks strip me of my armour, here where I fall close to the ships, then it will be a reproach and a cause of shame to you through all your days. Hold your ground with courage, and urge on the men.’</p>
<p>As he spoke death descended over his mouth and eyes, and Patroclus set his foot on his chest, and drew the spear from the flesh, the whole midriff yielding with it, releasing the point of the blade and Sarpedon’s spirit, while the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a> held the panting horses, the creatures eager to flee now the chariots lacked their masters.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246132">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI508">XVI:508-568</span> Glaucus rouses the Lycians and Trojans</h3>
<p>Deep sorrow gripped&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#GlaucusHippolochus">Glaucus</a>&nbsp;on hearing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>’s call: his heart was pained seeing no way to help him. Distressed by the arrow-wound that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Teucer">Teucer</a>, fighting for his comrades’ lives, had dealt him, as he charged the Achaean wall, he gripped his damaged arm with his other hand. He prayed though to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, the Far-Striker: ‘Lord, hear me wherever you are, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycia</a>’s rich land perhaps or even here in Troy, for you always hear a man in sorrow, as I sorrow now. The wound I have is grievous, my arm a mass of pain; the blood will not clot, the shoulder is numb. I can’t grip my spear to fight to the enemy. And Sarpedon, son of Zeus, the best of us is gone, for Zeus cannot even save his own child. Heal me of this foul wound, Lord Apollo, ease my pain, give me the strength to rally my Lycians, rouse their courage, and fight over the body of the fallen.’</p>
<p>So he prayed, and Apollo heard, quelling the pain, clotting the black blood flowing from the deep wound, and filling his heart with courage. Glaucus recognised immortal aid, glad of the god’s swift answer. He ran to rally the Lycians, and urge them to fight for Sarpedon’s corpse, then sought the Trojan leaders,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polydamas">Polydamas</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Panthous">Panthous</a>, noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agenor">Agenor</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>&nbsp;and bronze-clad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>. He found the latter and addressed him with winged words: ‘Hector, you forget your allies now, we who are spending our lives for you, far from our friends and our native land. You give not a thought to their protection. Sarpedon has fallen, chief of the Lycian shield-men, the strong and just defender of Lycia. Bronze-clad Ares has brought him down at the point of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>’s spear. Take your stand, beside his body, friends, dread the breath of shame if the Myrmidons, in anger over those Danaan dead we slew with our spears by the swift ships, strip him of his armour and desecrate his corpse.’</p>
<p>The Trojans were gripped by a deep intolerable sorrow, for Sarpedon though from a far country was a mainstay of their army, as much for his eminence in warfare as for the host of men he brought with him. Hector, in his anger, took the lead as they charged savagely towards the Greeks. But brave Patroclus, son of Menoetius, spurred the Achaeans on. He called to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Aiantes</a>, both already filled with zeal: ‘Now, my lords, drive off the foe, and prove as brave as ever, no, braver still. Sarpedon, who breached our wall, is dead. Let’s take the corpse, strip it of its armour, mangle the flesh and slay with the merciless bronze any of his friends who try to save it.’</p>
<p>He spoke to the willing. Then both sides, strengthening their numbers, met in battle with a mighty roar, the Trojans and Lycians, the Myrmidons and Achaeans, fighting over the body of the fallen, their battle gear clanging. And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a> wrapped the fog of war about the fierce conflict, so that the vicious toils of battle might wreathe his dear dead son.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246133">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI569">XVI:569-683</span> The fight over Sarpedon’s body</h3>
<p>At first the Trojans repelled the fierce Achaeans, killing one of the best of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>&nbsp;noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Epeigeus">Epeigeus</a>, son of brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agacles">Agacles</a>. He had been king in populous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Budeum">Budeum</a>, but having killed a noble kinsman had found sanctuary with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>&nbsp;and silver-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>. They sent him with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, breaker of battle lines, to horse-taming Troy to fight against the Trojans. He had just laid hands on the body when glorious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;struck him on the head with a stone, shattering the skull inside the heavy helm, so he fell, face down, on the corpse, and death that takes the spirit embraced him. Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;was plunged in grief for his dead friend, and he swept through the front line swift as the falcon that scatters jackdaws and starlings. Straight at the Lycians and Trojans, you flew, Patroclus, master horseman, your heart filled with wrath at your comrade’s death.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sthenelaus">Sthenelaus</a>, he killed, dear son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ithaemenes">Ithaemenes</a>, striking his neck with a stone, tearing the sinews, and the front line led by glorious Hector gave ground. As far as a man, trialling his strength perhaps or attacked by bloodthirsty foes in battle, can hurl a long javelin the Trojans withdrew before the Achaean advance. Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#GlaucusHippolochus">Glaucus</a>, leading the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lycia">Lycian</a>&nbsp;shield-men, turned and killed bold&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Bathycles">Bathycles</a>, beloved son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Chalcon">Chalcon</a>, who lived in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hellas">Hellas</a>, first among Myrmidons in wealth and land. Glaucus, spinning round on him as Bathycles tried to overtake him, struck the man deep in the chest with a blow of his spear. He fell with a thud, and the Greeks were overcome with grief at the fall of a worthy warrior, while the Trojans rejoiced, and ran in to surround the corpse.</p>
<p>But the Achaeans, full of courage still, advanced towards their foe.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Meriones">Meriones</a>&nbsp;it was who killed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#LaogonusOtenor">Laogonus</a>, brave son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Onetor">Onetor</a>&nbsp;the priest of Idaean Zeus, honoured by the people like a god. He struck the fully armoured warrior beneath the jaw by the ear, and his spirit fled from his body, and the hated dark descended. Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeneas">Aeneas</a>&nbsp;replied hurling his bronze-tipped spear at Meriones hoping to catch him as he came forward covered himself with his shield. But Meriones was on the alert and avoided the missile, stooping low so the long spear fell to earth behind him, and fixed itself quivering in the ground until the mighty war-god stilled its fury. Aeneas enraged, shouted out angrily: ‘Meriones, fine dancer that you are, if that had struck your dancing days were done.’</p>
<p>And Meriones, the famous spearman, replied: ‘Aeneas, you may be strong, but even you can’t kill everyone who attacks you, not if they know how to defend themselves. You too are mortal, I think. If I aimed well enough with my keen spear, strong as you are and trusting in your strength, still the glory would soon be mine and you on your way to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>&nbsp;the Horse Lord.’</p>
<p>At this, great Patroclus reproached him: ‘Meriones, fine warrior that you are, why waste time on words? Speeches, good friend, won’t drive the Trojans from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sarpedon">Sarpedon</a>’s body. The earth will take not a few of us before that moment comes, so less words and more action, the fate of this struggle is in our hands, keep your oratory for the council.’</p>
<p>With this, he led a charge, and godlike Meriones followed. Then the beaten earth sent up a din of bronze and leather, of solid shields, like the resounding echo of axe-men in the mountain glades, while the warriors thrust at one another with keen swords and double-edged spears. No friend of his would have known the face of noble Sarpedon, veiled as he was from head to foot by dust and gore and lost in a hail of missiles. Round the corpse the warriors swarmed, as flies in the farmyard hum round the brimming pails, at milking time in spring. And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;fixed his gleaming eye on the desperate conflict, gazing down and reflecting on Patroclus’ fate, whether as they struggled over godlike Sarpedon noble Hector should kill him with his sword, and strip the armour from him, or whether more men should die first, in the toils of battle. And in the end he thought it best that Achilles’ powerful comrade should drive bronze-clad Hector and the Trojans further towards the city, while wreaking greater havoc.</p>
<p>First he stirred Hector to sorry flight. He leapt to his chariot and calling to the Trojans led the rout, knowing that Zeus had tipped the sacred balance against them. Then the brave Lycians yielded ground, and they too were driven off, having seen their king struck to the heart, and left among the dead, for many had fallen there as the son of Cronos tightened the net of that vicious conflict. From Sarpedon’s shoulders the Greeks stripped the gleaming bronze armour, and bold Patroclus left his men to bear it back to the hollow ships.</p>
<p>Now it was that Zeus, the Cloud Gatherer, called to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>: ‘Dear Phoebus, go now and carry Sarpedon out of range of the battle, and cleanse the black blood from his body, then lift him to some distant place, bathe him in running water, anoint him with ambrosia, clothe him in imperishable garments, and give him to those twin brothers Sleep and Death, who bear men swiftly away. They will soon set him down in the broad rich lands of Lycia. There his brothers and all his kin will bury him beneath barrow and pillar, since the dead are owed that privilege.’</p>
<p>Apollo promptly obeyed his father’s words, speeding towards the sound of bitter conflict from the heights of Ida. At once he bore noble Sarpedon far from the war, bathed, anointed and clothed him, and gave him over to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hypnus">Sleep</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thanatos">Death</a> to carry to the broad rich Lycian lands.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246134">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI684">XVI:684-725</span> Apollo directs the fight before the city</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, now, ordered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a>&nbsp;to whip the horses on in pursuit of the Trojans and Lycians, in a fit of blind foolishness! Had he obeyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>’ advice he’d have escaped dark death, and an evil fate, but the will of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;is greater than man’s will, and even a brave man he may readily cause to panic, robbing him of glory, and just as readily inspire a man to fight. He it was who now filled Patroclus with rashness.</p>
<p>Who then was the first to fall to you, Patroclus, and who the last, when the gods drew you to your death? The first were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AdrastusTrojan2">Adrastus</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AutonousTrojan">Autonous</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EcheclusTrojan">Echeclus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Perimus">Perimus</a>&nbsp;son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Megas">Megas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Epistor">Epistor</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#MelanippusTrojan2">Melanippus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Elasus">Elasus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#MuliusTrojan1">Mulius</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PylartesTrojan2">Pylartes</a>. These were the first he killed and the rest thought only of flight.</p>
<p>Then the sons of Achaea would have captured Troy of the lofty gates, behind the wide-ranging spear of fierce Patroclus, if Phoebus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;has not mounted the high wall to aid the Trojans and seek the warrior’s ruin. Three times Patroclus scaled an angle of the lofty wall, and three times Apollo hurled him down, his immortal hands thrusting away his glittering shield. And when, as if possessed, he mounted yet a fourth time Apollo checked him with a dreadful cry: ‘Withdraw, Zeus-born Patroclus, I say your spear is not fated to capture noble Troy, nor is that of your master Achilles!’</p>
<p>At this, Patroclus fell back a goodly distance, to avoid Apollo the Far-Striker’s wrath.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;had reined in his horses at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScaeanGates">Scaean</a>&nbsp;Gate, unsure whether to wheel them back into the conflict, and fight, or order his men back behind the walls. While he debated Phoebus Apollo appeared, in the strong and active figure of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AsiusDymas">Asius</a>, brother to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>&nbsp;and horse-taming Hector’s uncle. He was the son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dymas">Dymas</a>&nbsp;the Phrygian, who lived beside the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sangarius">Sangarius</a>. So disguised, Apollo, the son of Zeus, addressed him: ‘Why have you left the field, Hector? You should be there. I wish I were stronger again than you as I am weaker, and I’d teach you not to shirk your duty. Come now, hunt down Patroclus with that splendid team, and hope with Apollo’s help to kill him and win glory.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246135">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI726">XVI:726-776</span> The fight over Cebriones’ body</h3>
<p>With this, the god returned to the field of battle, while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;turned to warlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cebriones">Cebriones</a>&nbsp;and ordered him to whip up the horses. Now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, in the midst brought blind panic on the Argives, and paved the way for Hector and the Trojans. The rest of the Greeks Hector left alone, making no efforts to attack them, instead, with his powerful team, chasing down&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>. Patroclus at bay leapt from his chariot, his spear in his left hand, a large jagged gleaming stone clutched in his right. Planting his feet firmly, his fear of his foe swiftly dispelled, he hurled it with perfect aim, and struck Hector’s charioteer, Cebriones, a natural son of great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>, in the forehead, as he grasped the reins. The stone crushed his brow, shattering the bone, and his eyeballs fell in the dust at his feet. He plunged like a diver from the sturdy chariot, and his spirit fled his bones. Then Patroclus, tamer of horses, how you mocked him: ‘There, what an acrobat, how skilfully he dives! So perfectly executed he’d do a fine job aboard ship, fishing oysters from teeming depths, despite the weather. The Trojans it seems make good divers too.’</p>
<p>With this he flung himself at the dead warrior, like a lion wounded in the chest while ravaging a farm, a victim of its own daring. So you leapt for Cebriones, Patroclus.</p>
<p>For his part, Hector too leapt from his chariot, and the two fought over the corpse, like mountain lions on the heights struggling over a hind, each as ravenous and spirited as the other. Over Cebriones, those two of the loud war-cry, Hector and Patroclus, tried eagerly to pierce each other’s flesh with the merciless bronze.</p>
<p>Hector grasped the body by its head, and held on tight, while Patroclus gripped the feet as hard, and round them the Greeks and Trojans swirled in mighty combat. Like the East and South winds, buffeting each other, shaking the depths of some mountain glade, whirling long boughs of beech and ash and smooth-barked cornel together, with a vast roar and the crack of breaking branches, so the Greeks and Trojans battered and slew each other, with never a thought on either side of yielding. A host of sharp spears bristled in the earth round Cebriones, and a host of feathered arrows sent twanging from the bow, while huge stones bounced from the shields of the struggling men. But he lay in the dust, sublime in his great fall, no longer mindful of his horsemanship.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246136">Bk</span><span id="BkXVI777">XVI:777-867</span> The death of Patroclus</h3>
<p>So long as the sun was high in the sky, the volleys of missiles found their mark, and men fell, but when it sank low at that hour when ploughmen unyoke their oxen, the Greeks proved masters of their fate. They dragged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cebriones">Cebriones</a>’ corpse away from the Trojans and, beyond the clash of arms, stripped it of its armour. Then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;was minded to destroy the Trojans. Three times that peer of swift Ares attacked them, shouting his dread war-cry, and each time killed nine men. But when, like a god, you charged at them again, Patroclus, then your fate loomed in sight. For&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;met you, terrible in combat.</p>
<p>Apollo advanced, veiled in a dense mist, invisible to Patroclus in the tumult, stood behind him and struck him in the back with the flat of his hand. The warrior’s vision spun, as Apollo knocked the helmet from his head, sending it under the horses’ feet with a clang, and the plumes on its crest were streaked with blood and dust. The gods had never allowed it to be fouled till then, that horsehair-plumed helmet that protected the godlike brow and head of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>: now Zeus let Hector wear it for a while, since death was nearing him too.</p>
<p>The long-shadowed spear, thick, heavy and strong, and tipped with bronze, in Patroclus’ hands was wholly shattered, the tasselled shield on its strap fell to the ground, and that blow from Lord Apollo, son of Zeus, had loosened the breastplate. Then Patroclus’ mind was dimmed, his noble limbs were slack beneath him, and dazed he stood there. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dardania">Dardanian</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Panthous">Panthous</a>’ son&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Euphorbus">Euphorbus</a>, the best spearman, horseman and runner of his generation, who had brought down twenty charioteers in this his apprenticeship in war, now cast his sharp spear and struck Patroclus in the back between the shoulders. He was first to hurl his spear, not killing you, horse-tamer Patroclus, but pulling the ash spear from your flesh and running back into the throng, fearing to stand and fight you, unarmed now though you were. And Patroclus, stunned by the god’s blow and Euphorbus’ spear, retreated into the Myrmidon ranks, dodging fate.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, seeing brave Patroclus withdraw, struck by the blade, made his way to him through the ranks, and drove at him with his spear, piercing the lower belly and ramming the point home. Patroclus fell with a thud, to the grievous sorrow of the Achaean army. As a lion in the high mountains may fight with a tireless wild boar over a trickling stream from which both seek to drink, and conquers his panting enemy by strength alone, so Hector, Priam’s son, overcame the valiant son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menoetius">Menoetius</a>, who himself had killed so many men, and striking him close at hand with his spear robbed him of his life. Then straddling him, he shouted in victory: ‘I think you boasted you’d sack our city, Patroclus, take our women captive, sail with them to your native land. How foolish! Hector and his swift horses are here to fight for them, Hector the finest spearman among the warlike Trojans, I who shield them from the day of doom, while as for you, the vultures shall have you. Even Achilles, with all his valour, could not save you, wretched man, though I don’t doubt he told you as you left, for he chose to stay: “Patroclus, master horseman, don’t return to the hollow ships till you’ve pierced the tunic at man-killing Hector’s chest and drenched it in his blood.” No doubt that’s what he said, and you in your madness though it would be so.’</p>
<p>But though your strength was ebbing fast, horse-taming Patroclus, yet you answered: ‘Boast, while you can, Hector, for Zeus and Apollo it was who gave you victory. They conquered me: they stripped the armour from my shoulders. If twenty men like you had faced me alone, all would have died at the point of my spear. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Fates">Fate</a>&nbsp;the destroyer and Apollo,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Leto">Leto</a>’s son, have conquered: only then came Euphorbus the mortal, while you are but the third to claim my life. This I tell you: and go brood upon it. You indeed have only a little while to live, even now death approaches and your fixed destiny, to fall at the hands of Achilles, peerless scion of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeacus">Aeacus</a>.’</p>
<p>With these words death took him, and his spirit, loosed from his limbs, fled down to Hades, bemoaning its fate and leaving youth and manhood behind. But dead though he was, noble Hector still replied: ‘Patroclus, what makes you so sure of my swift destruction? Who knows but Achilles, son of fair-haired&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>, may be struck by my spear first, and lose his life?’</p>
<p>With this, he planted his heel on the warrior’s body, drew the spear from the wound, and thrust the corpse away, to fall on its back. Then he launched himself with the spear at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a>, godlike squire of fleet-footed Achilles, grandson of Aeacus. He was keen to strike him down, but the swift team swept Automedon away, those immortal steeds, the glorious gifts the gods gave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book XVIII</h2>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246220">Bk</span><span id="BkXVIII1">XVIII:1-</span>77 Thetis responds to Achilles’ sorrow</h3>
<p>So the fighting raged, while swift-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Antilochus">Antilochus</a>&nbsp;brought the news to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>. He found him in front of the high-sterned ships, agonising over the war, communing anxiously with his proud heart: ‘What woe is this? Why are the long-haired Greeks in flight? Why are they being driven back once more from the plain to the ships? Is this another sorrow sent by the gods, one that my mother prophesied? Did she not say that while I still lived the best of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>&nbsp;would forgo the light of day at Trojan hands? Is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;dead, in his rashness: despite my warning, to return to the ships once the fire was out, and not to battle&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>?’</p>
<p>He was lost like this in reflection, when Antilochus, bathed in scalding tears, brought the bitter news: ‘Alas, warlike son of Peleus, sad are the tidings you must hear. Would it were not so, but Patroclus has fallen, and they fight over his corpse, his naked corpse, for Hector of the gleaming helm has your armour.’</p>
<p>At these words, a black cloud of grief shrouded Achilles. Grasping handfuls of dark sand and ash, he poured them over his head and handsome face, soiling his scented tunic. Then he flung himself in the dust, and lying there outstretched, a fallen giant, tore and fouled his hair. The slave girls he and Patroclus had seized as prizes, shrieked with alarm, and ran to warlike Achilles, beating their breasts and sinking to the ground beside him. Antilochus, weeping and groaning, grasped Achilles’ hand, fearing he might take his knife and cut his own throat, so heart-felt was his noble grief.</p>
<p>Such a dreadful a groan did Achilles give voice to that his divine mother&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>&nbsp;heard him, deep beneath the sea where she sat beside her ancient&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nereus">Father</a>. She cried out, and all the divinities, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nereids">Nereids</a>&nbsp;of the depths, gathered to her.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Glauce">Glauce</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thaleia">Thaleia</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cymodoce">Cymodoce</a>&nbsp;were there;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nesaea">Nesaea</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Speio">Speio</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thoe">Thoe</a> and ox-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Halie">Halie</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cymothoe">Cymothoe</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Actaea">Actaeë</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Limnoreia">Limnoreia</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Melite">Melite</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iaera">Iaera</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amphithoe">Amphithoe</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agave">Agave</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Doto">Doto</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Proto">Proto</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pherusa">Pherusa</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dynamene">Dynamene</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dexamene">Dexamene</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amphinome">Amphinome</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Callianeira">Callianeira</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Doris">Doris</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Panope">Panope</a>&nbsp;and far-famed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Galatea">Galetea</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nemertes">Nemertes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apseudes">Apseudes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Callianassa">Callianassa</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#ClymeneNereid">Clymene</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ianeira">Ianeira</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ianassa">Ianassa</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Maera">Maera</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Oreithyia">Oreithyia</a>, long-haired&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Amatheia">Amatheia</a>; all the daughters of the deep.</p>
<p>The bright sea-cave was filled with nymphs, beating their breasts, and Thetis led the lament: ‘Sisters, listen all, so you may hear and know the sadness in my heart. How wretched I am, who to my sorrow bore the best of men! I brought a mighty and peerless son into this world, greatest of warriors. I nursed him like a shoot in a fertile orchard, and like a sapling swiftly he grew. I sent him to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ilium">Ilium</a>&nbsp;with the beaked ships, to fight the Trojans, but I shall never welcome him home once more to the house of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>. And even now, while he lives and knows the light of day, he suffers, beyond my help, though I go to him. And go I will, to see my dear child again, and hear what grief has come to one who refrains from battle.’</p>
<p>So saying, she left the cave with the weeping nymphs. They parted the waves till they came to the fertile land of Troy. One after another, they trod the shore, where the Myrmidon ships were beached in lines around swift Achilles. His divine mother reached his side, while he lay groaning there, and with a piercing cry took his head in her hands, and spoke to him winged words of sympathy: ‘My child, why these tears? What sadness overcomes you? Speak, don’t hide it from me. Surely, Zeus has fulfilled what you prayed for, now the whole Achaean army crouch at their ships sterns, suffering cruelly, and in sore need of you?’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246221">Bk</span><span id="BkXVIII78">XVIII:78-147</span> Thetis promises Achilles fresh armour</h3>
<p>Swift-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;sighed deeply: ‘Mother, it is true that Zeus has brought all this about, but what is that to me now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;my dear friend is dead, he whom I honoured more than all, honoured as my own self? I have lost him, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;who killed him has stripped him of my armour, the fine, the great, the wondrous armour the gods gave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>&nbsp;as a glorious wedding gift that day you wed your mortal spouse. How I wished you had stayed among the immortal sea-nymphs, and Peleus had taken a human bride. Now you too will know the immeasurable grief of losing a son, of never again welcoming him home alive. For my heart compels me not to linger among men once Hector is dead at the point of my spear, and has paid the price for despoiling Patroclus.’</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>, weeping, replied: ‘My child, your own death will swiftly be upon you if Hector dies, for your own doom must inexorably follow.’</p>
<p>Then swift-footed Achilles answered, passionately: ‘Let it follow instantly, since I could not save my friend from death. He needed my help to stave off ruin, and now far from his own land has he fallen. May discord be banished from among gods and men, all that enrages a man despite his wisdom, that insidious anger that rises in the breast like smoke, sweeter to it than trickling honey, for I shall not now return home, and I have failed to protect Patroclus and all those others whom noble Hector killed, idling here by my ships, a useless burden on the earth, I who am without peer in warfare among the bronze-clad Greeks, however superior the rest may be in council. Agamemnon, king of men, stirred just such a rage in my heart. But all is past and done, despite the pain, and we must curb the wrath in our hearts. So I will go now and find Hector, the man who killed my dearest friend, and accept death whenever Zeus and the other gods decide that I must die. Not even great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Heracles">Heracles</a>&nbsp;escaped his doom, dear as he was to Zeus, the son of Cronos,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>’s dread anger fated to overcome him. I too, if a like fate has been spun for me, will lie quiet when I am dead. But for now, let me win fame and glory too, and make many a deep-breasted Trojan woman moan without cease, wiping the tears from her tender cheeks with both her hands, to teach her how long I have been absent from the war. Though you love me, don’t try to keep me from battle, I will never be persuaded.’</p>
<p>‘What you say is right, my son,’ silver-footed Thetis replied, ‘it is right to save your hard-pressed friends from utter ruin. But the Trojans have your lovely armour, your shining bronze. Hector of the gleaming helm wears it and exults. Though not for long, I say, since his own death is upon him. So refrain from battle, until you see me here again. I will return tomorrow with the sun, and bring you glorious armour from Lord&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>.’</p>
<p>With that she turned to speak to her sister&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nereids">Nereids</a>: ‘Plunge beneath the broad surface of the deep, and go to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nereus">father</a>’s house, to the Old Man of the Sea. Tell him everything, while I go to lofty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Olympus">Olympus</a>, to Hephaestus, the master-craftsman, hoping that he will deign to give my son fresh shining armour.’</p>
<p>At this, they dived beneath the waves, while she, Thetis, the silver-footed goddess, set out for Olympus to win glorious armour for her beloved son.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246222">Bk</span><span id="BkXVIII148">XVIII:148-242</span> Hera tells Achilles to show himself to the Trojans</h3>
<p>While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>&nbsp;journeyed to Olympus, the Greeks, fleeing with shouts of terror from man-killing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, reached the ships by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hellespont">Hellespont</a>. But the bronze-greaved Achaeans had not yet borne&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>’ body out of range of all the missiles, and it was once more overtaken by the Trojan warriors and charioteers, led by Hector, son of Priam, fiery in his valour. Three times glorious Hector ran in from behind, shouting fiercely to his Trojans, and seized the corpse’s feet, eager to drag it back. Three times the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ajaxgreater">Aiantes</a>, resisting furiously, drove him from the body. But Hector, trusting in his strength, now attacking them in the turmoil, now standing off and calling to his men, would not retreat. They could no more frighten Hector off, than a pair of shepherds in the fields, trying to drive away a tawny lion, hungry for his kill. Even now, he might have dragged away the corpse and won eternal glory, had not swift-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iris">Iris</a>, sent by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, unbeknown to Zeus and the other gods except Pallas&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>, carried a message to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;to arm for war. Reaching him, she uttered winged words: ‘Up, son of Peleus, most daunting of men. Save the body of Patroclus, they are fighting over it beside the ships. Men are dying while your Greeks try to protect his corpse, and the Trojans attack, longing to drag him off to windy Troy. Glorious Hector is their leader, who sets his heart on slicing his head from the tender neck, and fixing it on a stake above the wall. Up then, and no more idling here! Fear shame in your heart if Patroclus becomes a plaything for the dogs of Troy. You will be the one to reproach if the corpse comes mutilated to our hands.’</p>
<p>Fleet-footed noble Achilles answered: ‘Iris, dear goddess: which of the immortals sends you with this message?’</p>
<p>And Iris, swift as the wind, replied: ‘Zeus’ glorious wife, Hera, sent me. The son of Cronus, Zeus the king supreme, knows nothing of it nor do any of the other gods and goddesses of snow-topped Olympus, but Pallas Athene.’</p>
<p>‘But how can I go into action?’ said swift-footed Achilles. The Trojans have my armour, and my dear mother told me not to ready myself for battle until I see her here again. She has promised fresh armour for me, from Lord&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>. I know of no other arms I could use, except for Telamonian Ajax’s shield. But he, I imagine, is in the front ranks fighting, plying his spear to defend dead Patroclus.’</p>
<p>Iris, swift as the wind, replied once more: ‘Your armour is in their hands, that we know, but go to the trench as you are and show yourself to the Trojans, hoping they fear the sight of you enough to cease from fighting. It would give the Greek warriors chance to catch their breath, exhausted as they are, for there are few such chances in battle.’</p>
<p>Fleet-footed Iris departed, while Achilles, beloved of Zeus, rose to his feet. Athene flung her tasselled aegis over his broad shoulders, shed a bright golden mist about his head, and made a fiery glare blaze from the man. Like the beacons that one by one flare out at sunset from an island besieged by an enemy, its city cloaked all day by smoke rising to high heaven, for whose safety men fought from the battlements all day in bitter conflict; like those beacons, whose light shines out on high for all their neighbours to see, in hopes they might send their ships to the rescue, so the blaze shone from Achilles’ head to the heavens.</p>
<p>He took his stand by the wall beyond the trench, but remembering his mother’s careful injunction, avoided joining the Greek ranks. He stood and shouted, and Pallas Athene echoed him from afar, confounding the Trojans utterly. Achilles’ voice was loud, clear as the trumpet sounding from some beleaguered city, beset by a lethal force. The hearts of the Trojans were appalled when they heard that voice of bronze, and the long-maned horses wheeled the chariots round, filled with dread. Terror-stricken the charioteers saw the restless fire blazing from the head of Peleus’ mighty son, fed by the goddess, bright-eyed Athene. Three times noble Achilles shouted beyond the trench, three times the Trojans and their allies reeled in panic. A dozen of their finest warriors died, there and then, ringed by their own chariots and spears.</p>
<p>But the Greeks, overjoyed, bore Patroclus out of range, and laid him on his bier, while his dear friends stood round it weeping. And fleet-footed Achilles joined them, shedding hot tears, when he saw his faithful friend lying there, mangled by the cruel bronze. With chariot and horses he had sent him to the battle, never to welcome him back alive again.</p>
<p>And now ox-eyed Queen Hera told the tireless sun, to return, though unwillingly, to Ocean’s stream. At last he set, and the noble Achaeans rested from mighty conflict, and war’s evils.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246223">Bk</span><span id="BkXVIII243">XVIII:243-309</span> The Trojan Assembly</h3>
<p>The Trojans, for their part, having withdrawn from battle, loosed the swift horses from their chariots, and without thinking of eating gathered in assembly. They stood throughout, too anxious to sit, unnerved by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>’ sudden appearance after his long absence from the front. The cautious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polydamas">Polydamas</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Panthous">Panthous</a>, spoke first: he alone looked before and after. He was a friend of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s, born on the same night, the best in oratory as Hector was in war. He addressed the assembly now, speaking for their good: ‘Think about all this carefully, my friends. Since we are so far from the city walls, I recommend that we retreat there, and not wait here by the ships till dawn. The Achaeans were easier to handle while this man quarrelled with King&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, then I too was pleased to spend the night close to the swift ships, hoping to destroy them. But now I fear fleet-footed Achilles greatly. He is too impetuous to settle for fighting in the plain, where Greeks and Trojans suffer war equally, he will attack the city, putting our womenfolk at threat. Take my advice and retreat, or expect the worst. Fleet-footed Achilles must bow to immortal night for now, but if he enters the battle armed, at dawn, you all will know of it. Whoever returns alive to sacred Ilium will rejoice, but many the dogs and vultures will devour. Far from my ears may such news stay! Yet if you follow my advice, however unwillingly, we’ll assemble in the square tonight, surrounded by the walls and lofty gates with their high gleaming doors bolted tight. Then, at dawn, we’ll man the walls fully armed, and if Achilles decides to quit the ships and attack the city, so much the worse for him. He’ll soon retreat again, when he’s had enough of driving his proud horses to and fro beneath the battlements in vain. Even his courageous heart will not sack the city: the running dogs will eat him first.’</p>
<p>But Hector of the gleaming helm, replied with a flash of anger: ‘Polydamas, I can’t approve of that idea, penning ourselves inside the city. Are you not tired of being caged by those walls? There was a time when men acclaimed Priam’s city for its wealth of gold and bronze, but our fine treasures and many dear possessions have been traded to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phrygia">Phrygia</a>&nbsp;and fair&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Maeonia">Maeonia</a>, since we incurred Zeus’ wrath. Don’t be foolish with your advice, now Zeus the son of devious Cronos, grants me the power to win glory by the ships and drive the Greeks to the sea. I’ll not let a single Trojan obey. Rather, we’ll do as I advise, go to eat company by company, keep a good watch here, and stay awake. And any of the Trojans concerned for his possessions at home, can gather them together and hand them over for all to share, better they profit from them than the Greeks. But at dawn, and armed, we’ll attack the ships, and if indeed Achilles is stirred to action, the worse for him. I won’t run from him in a battle, but fight him face to face, and see whether he shall win or I. The war-god treats all men alike, and often kills the one who thought to kill.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246224">Bk</span><span id="BkXVIII310">XVIII:310-367</span> The lamentation for Patroclus</h3>
<p>The Trojans foolishly acclaimed his speech. Pallas&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;robbed them of their judgement in praising&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;whose plan was faulty, and not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polydamas">Polydamas</a>&nbsp;whose advice was good, and so they took their meal, throughout the ranks, while all night long the Greeks lamented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>. The leader in that outpouring of grief was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, who placed his warlike hands on his friend’s chest, and groaned endlessly, like a bearded lion whose cubs a stag-hunter has snatched from some dense thicket. The lion returns and grieves at their absence, then, filled with fierce wrath, tracks the man through many a glade, hoping to find them. So Achilles grieved among the Myrmidons: ‘How idle the promise I gave to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menoetius">Menoetius</a>&nbsp;in my father’s house, as I tried to solace him, that when I’d sacked Troy I’d bring back his glorious son to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Opoeis">Opoeis</a>&nbsp;for him, with all his share of the spoils. But Zeus does not fulfil all our plans. And we are both fated to stain the selfsame earth here at Troy with our blood, for I shall not return home either, to be welcomed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>&nbsp;the charioteer, my aged father, and my mother&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>&nbsp;in their palace, instead this soil shall cover me. And since I’ll go beneath the ground after you, my Patroclus, I shall not hold your funeral rites, my brave friend, till I return with the head of your killer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s head, and my armour, and before your pyre I’ll slit the throats of twelve fine youths of Troy, to slake my anger at your slaughter. Till then lie here, like this, beside the beaked ships, while full-breasted Trojan and Dardanian women, the ones we laboured with our hands and spears to capture when we took their rich populated cities, grieve for you and shed tears night and day.’</p>
<p>With these words, great Achilles told his comrades to set a large cauldron on the fire, and heat water to fill a bath and wash the clotted blood from Patroclus. So they took wood and kindled it, filled the cauldron and set it on the blazing coals, and watched the flames play about its bronze belly till the water boiled. Then they filled the bath from the cauldron, and washed him, and anointed him with rich oil, filling the wounds with nine-year old unguent. Then they laid his body on the bier, shrouding it with soft linen cloth from head to foot, and on top of that a white robe. And all night long, round fleet-footed Achilles, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>&nbsp;moaned in grief for Patroclus.</p>
<p>Watching them,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;spoke to his sister-wife,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>: ‘Once more, my ox-eyed queen, you get your way, spurring fleet-footed Achilles into action. Those long-haired Greeks might as well be your own offspring.’ ‘Dread son of Cronos’, the ox-eyed queen replied, ‘what can you mean? Even mere mortals, that lack my wisdom, will do what they can for a friend. How could I, the greatest of goddesses, doubly so as the eldest and the wife of the king of all the gods, how could I refrain, in my anger with these Trojans, from causing them all the trouble I can?’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246225">Bk</span><span id="BkXVIII368">XVIII:368-467</span> Thetis asks Hephaestus for help</h3>
<p>As they spoke, silver-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>&nbsp;reached Hephaestus’ house of imperishable bronze, adorned with stars and finest among those of the immortals, built by the lame god himself. She found him running back and forth to his bellows, sweating with toil, as he fashioned twenty triple-legged tables to stand round the walls of his great hall. He had fitted their legs with golden wheels, so they might take themselves to the gods’ assembly if he wished, and roll home again, a wondrous sight. They were not quite finished, still lacking elaborate handles which he was burnishing while forging their rivets. It was as he laboured at these with all his care and skill that silver-footed Thetis approached.</p>
<p>Lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Charis">Charis</a>&nbsp;of the glistening veil, wife of the illustrious lame god, seeing her, came forward, took both her hands in hers and spoke: ‘Thetis of the long robe, honoured and welcome, though unaccustomed, guest, what brings you here? Follow me inside, so I may offer you hospitality.’</p>
<p>So saying she led the goddess inside, and made her sit on a splendid chair, elaborately adorned with silver studs, and with a footstool beneath. Then she summoned Hephaestus, the master-smith: ‘Hephaestus, come quickly! Thetis has need of you.’ Hephaestus answered at once: ‘Ah, a goddess I honour and revere is here in my house, she who saved me in my hour of agony, after my mother&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>, shamed by my lameness, threw me from Olympus. How I’d have suffered if Thetis and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eurynome">Eurynome</a>, daughter of encircling&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Ocean">Ocean</a>, had not taken me to their breasts. Staying with them nine years in their deep cave, I worked away at fine ornaments; brooches and spiral bracelets, necklaces and rosettes; while round me the vast stream of Ocean flowed, seething with foam. Neither gods nor mortals knew, only Thetis and Eurynome who rescued me. Now Thetis is here, and I must repay her fully for saving my life. Show her hospitality, while I put my tools and bellows away.’</p>
<p>So saying, his huge form rose from the anvil, and panting heavily, he limped about, though agile enough on his withered legs. He moved the bellows from the fire, and collecting his tools together placed them in a silver chest. Then he wiped his hands and face, huge neck, and shaggy breast, with a sponge, and donned his tunic. Grasping a thick staff he limped from the forge, supported by servants made of gold, fashioned like living girls, who attended swiftly on their master. As well as the use of their limbs they had intellect, and the immortals gave them skill in subtle crafts. They supported Hephaestus as he limped towards Thetis, and seated himself on a gleaming chair. Then he took her hand and spoke to her: ‘Thetis of the long robe, honoured and welcome, though unaccustomed, guest, what brings you here? Say what you need, and my heart prompts me to fulfil it, if it can be done, and I can do it.’</p>
<p>Thetis, weeping, answered: ‘Is there a goddess, Hephaestus, who has suffered more heartfelt sorrows at the hands of Zeus, than I? I alone of all the daughters of the sea he wedded to a mere human,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aeacus">Aeacus</a>, and unwillingly it was that I lay with a mortal man. He keeps to his palace now, weighed down sadly by the years, while I suffer further grief. I brought a mighty and peerless son into this world, greatest of warriors. I nursed him like a shoot in a fertile orchard, and like a sapling swiftly he grew. I sent him to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ilium">Ilium</a>&nbsp;with the beaked ships, to fight the Trojans, but I shall never welcome him home once more to the house of Peleus. And even now, while he lives and knows the light of day, he suffers, beyond my help, though I go to him. King&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>&nbsp;has taken from him the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Briseis">girl</a>&nbsp;the Achaeans gave him as a prize. Wasting his heart in grief for her, he refused to ward off ruin from the Greeks, despite the elders offering him fine gifts, and the Trojans penned them in by their ships sterns, and proved immoveable. Then he let&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;don his own armour and join the battle, with his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>. All day they fought by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScaeanGates">Scaean</a>&nbsp;Gate, and would have sacked the city, if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;had not caused the death of brave Patroclus at the height of his success, and granted the final act to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>. So I have come to clasp your knees, and ask you to give my son, who is doomed to an early death, a shield and helmet, a breastplate and bronze greaves fitted with ankle-pieces, to replace the armour lost when the Trojans killed his faithful friend, for whom my son now lies in the dust struck with grief to his very heart.’</p>
<p>The master-smith replied: ‘Take heart, and be easy in your mind. I wish that I could save him from sad death, when the fateful time arrives, as easily as I can grant him splendid armour, splendid enough to make many a man marvel who gazes on it some fine day.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246226">Bk</span><span id="BkXVIII468">XVIII:468-617</span> Hephaestus forges Achilles’ armour</h3>
<p>With this,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>&nbsp;returned to his forge, turned his bellows on the fire, and ordered them to begin. The set of twenty nozzles blew on the crucibles, sending out a varying blast of air at need, aiding his careful efforts as required, at every stage of the work. Into the crucibles went stubborn bronze, tin, precious gold and silver. He set up a great anvil on its block, and took a massive hammer in one hand and a pair of tongs in the other.</p>
<p>Then he first made a shield, broad and solid, adorning it skilfully everywhere, and setting round it a glittering triple rim, with a silver strap attached. Five layers it had, and he decorated it with subtle art.</p>
<p>On it he showed the earth, sea, sky, the tireless sun and the full moon, and all the constellations that crown the heavens, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pleiads">Pleiades</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hyades">Hyades</a>, great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Orion">Orion</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Bear">Bear</a>, that men also call the Wain, that circles round in its place, never bathing in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Ocean">Ocean</a>’s stream, while gazing warily at Orion.</p>
<p>On it he showed two fine cities of mortal men. In one there were marriage feasts, and to the light of blazing torches, the brides were led from their rooms and through the city, to the sound of wedding songs. Young men circled in the dance, whirling round to flutes and lyres, while women stood in their doorways gazing. But the men had gathered in assembly, where two of them were arguing a case, contesting the blood price to be paid for another’s death. The defendant claimed he had paid all that was right, putting this to the people, but the accuser refused his acceptance, and the pair of them sought arbitration. Both were cheered by their supporters, whom the heralds firmly restrained. The Elders sat on the sacred bench, a semi-circle of polished stone, receiving the speaker’s staff from the loud-voiced heralds, and rising to give judgement in turn. At their feet lay two talents of gold, the fee for the one who gave the soundest judgement.</p>
<p>The other city was besieged by two armies clad in glittering armour. Their plan was to attempt to sack it, or accept instead a half of all its wealth. But the citizens resisted, and secretly were arming for an ambush, their beloved wives, the children, and the old left to defend the walls, while the rest set out, led by Ares and Athene, all made of gold. Tall and beautiful in their golden clothes and armour, as gods should look, they rose above the smaller warriors at their feet. Another scene showed them by a river, a watering place for the herds and a likely place to mount their ambush, and there they were seated in their bronze armour. Then in another two scouts were posted, waiting for sight of a herd of sheep or glossy cattle. Then there was shown the herds’ arrival, with two herdsmen behind playing flutes, ignorant of the cunning ambush. Then the ambushers were seen, rushing out to attack them as they neared, quickly cutting out the herd of cattle and the fine white flock of sheep, killing the herdsmen. Next, the besiegers were shown, sitting in assembly, or rising at the sound of cattle, or mounting behind their high-stepping steeds and racing towards the action. And finally he showed the ranks in battle at the river, attacking each other with bronze-tipped spears. Strife and Panic were at work, and ruthless Fate, here laying her hands on one man freshly wounded, there on another still unscathed, and next dragging a corpse through the chaos by its feet. The cloak about her shoulders was red with human blood. Just like living men they seemed to clash and fight, and drag away the bodies of those killed.</p>
<p>On the shield also, he depicted fallow-land, soft, rich, broad and thrice-ploughed, and on it ploughmen were driving their teams to and fro, and where they turned at the field’s end a man held a cup of honeyed wine in his hands to give to them, so they were eager to wheel about at the end of the rich furrow. Behind them the field, though made of gold, looked black as if it had been ploughed, a wonderful feature of the work.</p>
<p>On the shield also, he showed a royal estate, where labourers were reaping, with sharp sickles in their hands. Armfuls of corn were falling in swathes along the rows, while sheaves were being bound with twists of straw. Boys were gathering up the armfuls and carrying them to the three binders, while the king, staff in hand, stood joyfully and silently beside them. Heralds in the background beneath an oak were readying a feast, dressing a great sacrificial ox they had slaughtered, while women sprinkled the meat with white barley ready for the labourers to eat.</p>
<p>On the shield also, he portrayed in gold a fine vineyard laden with grapes, though the clusters of heavy fruit were black, and the vines were tied to silver poles. Round it was a ditch of blue enamel, and outside that a fence of tin and a single path led to it, that served for all the coming and going of harvest time. Girls and youths, were joyfully carrying off the ripe grapes in wicker baskets, while in their midst a boy sang of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Linos">Linos</a>, in a sweet treble voice, to the pleasant music of the clear-toned lyre. They all skipped along, with a chorus of cries, beating the earth in time, with dancing feet.</p>
<p>Then on the shield he showed a herd of straight-horned cattle, in gold and tin, lowing as they trotted from their byre to graze at a murmuring stream beside the swaying rushes. Four herdsmen, also in gold, walked beside them, and nine swift dogs ran behind. But in the next scene two savage lions in amongst the leaders were gripping a bull that bellowed loudly, dragging it off, pursued by youths and dogs. The lions had torn the bull’s flank open, and were devouring its innards, lapping the dark blood, while the herdsmen tried in vain to set the swift hounds on them, the dogs scared to grapple, but running in barking, then leaping aside.</p>
<p>On the shield, also, the lame master-smith added meadowland full of white sheep, in a fine valley, with sheepfolds, huts and pens.</p>
<p>Then he inlaid an intricate dancing floor like that which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Daedalus">Daedalus</a>&nbsp;once made in spacious&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cnossus">Cnossos</a>&nbsp;for long-haired&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Ariadne">Ariadne</a>. Young men, and girls worth many cattle, were dancing there, their hands clasping one another’s wrists. The girls wore white linen with pretty garlands on their heads; the young men fine-woven tunics with a soft sheen, daggers of gold hanging from their silver belts. Here, they danced lightly with skilful steps, like the motion a potter gives his wheel when testing it out to see how it will run. There, they ran in lines to meet each other. And enjoying the lovely scene, a host of people stood round about, while a pair of acrobats whirled among them, keeping time to the dance.</p>
<p>Finally, round the rim of the solid shield, he laid out the mighty stream of Ocean.</p>
<p>When the large heavy shield was done, he made a breastplate for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;that shone brighter than flame; a massive helmet to fit his head, a fine one cleverly embossed with a crest of gold; and greaves of pliable tin.</p>
<p>And when the lame god had wrought the armour, he took it and set it down in front of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>. Then she swooped like a falcon, from snow-topped Olympus, bearing Hephaestus’ gleaming gift.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book XXII</h2>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246419">Bk</span><span id="BkXXII1">XXII:1-</span>89 Priam and Hecabe fail to dissuade Hector</h3>
<p>The Trojans, having fled like a herd of frightened deer, now leant on the battlements around the city, drying the sweat from their bodies, and quenching their thirst, as the Greeks approached the wall, their shields at the slope. But deadly Fate enticed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;to halt by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScaeanGates">Scaean</a>&nbsp;Gate, in front of the city.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Phoebus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;revealed himself to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>: ‘Why, son of Peleus, being only mortal, do you run after me, a deathless god? Only now it seems do you know me, so great your fury! Have you forgotten the Trojans you routed? They have found refuge in the city, while you linger here, trying to kill one who cannot die.’</p>
<p>Then swift-footed Achilles replied, in consternation: ‘Far-Striker, you are the cruellest of gods. You’ve lured me here, far from the wall, while many who should have bitten the dust reach Ilium. You rob me of my glory, to save them, an easy task for one safe himself from vengeance, for I would indeed revenge myself on you if I had the power.’ So saying, Achilles ran eagerly towards the city, his legs pounding away like a winning thoroughbred coursing over the plain in the chariot traces.</p>
<p>Old&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;was first to see him, racing over the plain, his bronze breastplate gleaming like Sirius, the star of harvest, brightest of stars in the dark of night.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Orion">Orion</a>’s Dog, men call it, glittering brightly yet boding ill, bringing fever to wretched mortals. The old man groaned aloud, and raising his arms, beat his head with his hands, shouting entreaties to his dear son, who stood before the Gate, ready to turn his fury on Achilles.</p>
<p>Stretching out his arms, he called to him piteously: ‘Hector, dear child, I beg you, don’t face that man alone. Seek help, lest you meet your doom at the hands of Achilles, a stronger and tougher warrior than you. If the gods loved him as little as I do, the dogs and vultures would soon feed on his corpse, and my heart would be eased of a burden of sorrow, for he has robbed me of many fine sons, killing them or selling them in some far off isle. This very day I miss my two sons,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#LycaonPriam">Lycaon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#PolydorusPriam">Polydorus</a>, whom&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Laothoe">Laothoe</a>, princess among women, bore me. I failed to see them among the troops taking refuge in the city. If they are living, and held captive, we’ll ransom them with gold and bronze, from my great store.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Altes">Altes</a>, of glorious name, gave his daughter many gifts. But if they are dead, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>’ Halls, that is one more sorrow for their mother and I, who engendered them. Yet the people’s mourning will be briefer, if Achilles fails to kill you too. So take refuge behind the walls, my child, and be the saviour of the Trojans: stay alive, deny this son of Peleus glory. Have pity on me too while I live, I, poor wretch, for whom it seems Father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;reserves a dreadful fate, here after much sorrowful experience, on the threshold of old age, to see my sons slaughtered, my daughters dishonoured, their children hurled aside in anger, my son’s wives dragged away, my treasures fallen into savage Achaean hands. In the end, I shall be slain by a thrust from some sharp spear, and the flesh-eating dogs before my door will tear my corpse apart, the very dogs I fed from my table, reared to guard these same doors, dogs that will lie there in the gateway when in their savagery they’ve lapped my blood. It is fine for a young man, killed in battle, to lie there with his wounds on display: dead though he is, it’s an honourable sight. But an old man’s naked corpse, his grey hairs soiled by the dogs, is a pitiful matter for us wretched mortals.’</p>
<p>With this, the old man tore and plucked the grey hairs from his head, but failed to move Hector’s heart. Even though his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">mother</a> in turn began to weep and wail, pushing aside the folds of her robe and baring her breast, imploring him as she wept: ‘Hector, my child, this is the breast that fed you: respect and pity me. Think of us, and oppose the foe from inside the wall, don’t stand and face that harsh warrior, for if he kills you I’ll not have your corpse to lay on a bier and grieve over, dear child of my body, nor will the wife you richly dowered; but far from us, by the Argive ships, the running dogs will devour you.’</p>
<h3><span id="BkXXII90">Bk</span><span id="anchor_Toc239246420">XXII:90-130 Hector considers his situation</span></h3>
<p>So they entreated their dear son with tears. But all their earnest pleas could not change&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s mind, and he waited on great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>’ advance. Like a snake in the hills, full of venom due to the toxic herbs it eats, that glares balefully and writhes inside its hole, waiting as some man approaches, so Hector held his ground, filled with latent power, his bright shield resting on a jutting outwork. But his proud thoughts were troubled: ‘Alas, if I retreat through the gate, to the safety of the wall,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polydamas">Polydamas</a>&nbsp;will not be slow to reproach me, since he advised me to withdraw our forces to the city, on that fatal night when Achilles re-appeared. I refused, though it may have been better! Now, in my folly, having brought us to the brink of ruin, I’d be ashamed to hear some insignificant Trojan, or his long-robed wife, say: ‘Hector has brought ruin on the army, trusting too much in his own right arm.’ If that’s what they’ll say, then I’d be better by far to meet Achilles face to face and kill him before returning to the city, or die gloriously beneath its walls. Of course, I could ditch the bossed shield and heavy helmet, lean my spear on the wall, and go and promise peerless Achilles to return&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Helen">Helen</a>&nbsp;and her treasure to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Menelaus">Atreidae</a>, all that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a> brought in the hollow ships to Troy, to begin this strife. I could say too that we’ll then divide all the remaining treasure in the city, and then induce the Elders to state on oath that they’ll conceal no part of that treasure, but grant half of all the lovely city holds. But what’s the point of such thoughts? I’ll not approach him like a suppliant only to have him show neither mercy nor respect, but kill me out of hand, stripped of my armour and defenceless as a woman. This is no lover’s tryst of lad and lass, by oak or rock! Lad and lass, indeed! Better to meet in bloody combat, now, and see to whom Zeus grants the glory!</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246421">Bk</span><span id="BkXXII131">XXII:131-187</span> Achilles chases Hector round the walls</h3>
<p>While he stood there thinking,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, peer of Ares, approached, the plumes of his helmet nodding, brandishing the mighty spear of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pelion">Pelian</a>&nbsp;ash in his right hand, high above his shoulder, his bronze armour blazing like fire or the rising sun. Now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;was gripped by fear and, trembling at the sight of him, afraid to stand his ground by the gate, set off running. Achilles, confident in his own speed, pursued him. Like a hawk, swiftest of birds, swooping on a timorous dove in the mountains, darting towards her with fierce cries as she flees, eager to seize her, so Achilles ran and Hector fled as fast as he could in terror, below the Trojan wall. Passing the lookout point, and the wind-swept wild fig tree, along the cart-track they ran leaving the wall behind, and came to two lovely springs where the waters rise to feed the eddying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Scamander">Scamander</a>. One flows warm, and steam rises above it as smoke from a fire, while even in summer the other is ice-water, cold as freezing snow or hail. Nearby are the fine wide troughs of stone where the wives and daughters of the Trojans once washed their gleaming clothes in peace-time, before the advent of the Greeks. By the troughs they ran, one fleeing, one pursuing, a fine runner in front but a better one chasing him down behind, and this was no race for the prize of a bull’s hide or a sacrificial ox, a prize such as they give for running, they ran instead for the life of horse-taming Hector.</p>
<p>As thoroughbreds sweep round the turning-post, and compete for the prize of a fine tripod or a woman, to honour some dead warrior, so these two warriors ran swiftly three times round the city of Troy, while the gods looked on. And the Father of gods and men took it on himself to speak: ‘Well, now, here’s a sight! A man who is dear to me, chased round the walls, Hector whom my heart sorrows for, who has burned the thighs of countless oxen on many-ridged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Ida">Ida</a>’s heights for me, or on the summit of the citadel. Now noble Achilles, that great runner, hunts him round&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>’s city. Take counsel, immortals, decide! Shall we save him from death, or good man though he is, shall he die at the hands of Achilles, Peleus’ son?’</p>
<p>It was bright-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;who replied: ‘Father, Lord of the Lightning and the Storm, what is this? Would you save a mortal from sad death, to which he was doomed long ago? Do so, but don’t expect the rest of us to agree.’</p>
<p>Zeus, the Cloud-Gatherer, answered: ‘Easy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Tritogeneia">Tritogeneia</a>, my dear child, I was not in earnest, and I shall indulge you. Do as you will, and delay no longer.’ With this encouragement, the eager Athene darted down from the summit of Olympus.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246422">Bk</span><span id="BkXXII188">XXII:188-246</span> Athene incites Hector to fight</h3>
<p>Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;chased&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;relentlessly, and he could no more escape than a fawn, that a hound starts from a mountain covert. Chased through glade and valley it may cower for a while in some thicket, but the dog tracks it down, running strongly till he gains his quarry. So Achilles chased Hector. Every time Hector made a break for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dardania">Dardanian</a>&nbsp;Gate hoping to gain the shelter of the solid walls, where the defenders might protect him with their missiles, Achilles would head him off towards the plain, himself keeping the inner track by the walls. Yet, as in a dream where our pursuer cannot catch us nor we escape, Achilles could not overtake Hector, nor could Hector shake him off. Still, could Hector have eluded fate so long, had not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>, for the last and final time, come to strengthen him and speed him, and had not Achilles signalled to his men not to loose their deadly missiles at the man, lest he himself might be cheated of the glory? Yet when they reached The Springs for the fourth time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Father</a>&nbsp;raised his golden scales, and set the deaths of Achilles and horse-taming Hector in the balance, and lifted it on high. Down sank Hector’s lot towards&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>, and Phoebus Apollo left his side, while bright-eyed Athene came to Achilles and standing close, spoke winged words: ‘Glorious Achilles, beloved of Zeus, now you and I will kill Hector, and bring the Greeks great glory. Warlike he may be, but he’ll not escape us, even if Apollo, the Far-Striker, grovels before aegis-bearing Father Zeus. Stop now and catch your breath. I will go and incite him to fight you face to face.’</p>
<p>He, delighted, at once obeyed her words, halted and stood there leaning on his bronze-tipped ash spear, while she appeared to noble Hector in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Deiphobus">Deiphobus</a>, that tireless speaker: ‘Dear brother, swift Achilles pressed you hard there, chasing you round the city at a pace, but here let us make a stand together, and defend ourselves.’</p>
<p>Great Hector of the gleaming helm, replied: ‘Deiphobus, of all my brothers born to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>, you are by far the dearest, and now I’ll honour you in my mind even more, since you, while the others stay within and watch, have come to find me outside the wall.’</p>
<p>‘Dear brother,’ said bright-eyed Athene, in disguise, ‘our parents and friends in turn begged me not to come here, so terrified are they of Achilles, but I was tormented by anxiety. Let’s attack him head on, not spare our spears, and find out if he’ll kill us and carry our blood-stained armour to the hollow ships, or be conquered by our blades.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246423">Bk</span><span id="BkXXII247">XXII:247-366</span> The death of Hector</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;deceived Hector with her words and her disguise, and led him on till he and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;met.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;of the gleaming helm spoke first: ‘I will not run from you, as before, son of Peleus. My heart failed me as I waited for your attack, and three times round Priam’s city we ran, but now my heart tells me to stand and face you, to kill or be killed. Come let us swear an oath before the gods, for they are the best witnesses of such things. If Zeus lets me kill you and survive, then when I’ve stripped you of your glorious armour I’ll not mistreat your corpse, I’ll return your body to your people, if you will do the same for me.’</p>
<p>Swift-footed Achilles glared at him in reply: ‘Curse you, Hector, and don’t talk of oaths to me. Lions and men make no compacts, nor are wolves and lambs in sympathy: they are opposed, to the end. You and I are beyond friendship: nor will there be peace between us till one or the other dies and sates Ares, lord of the ox-hide shield, with his blood. Summon up your reserves of courage, be a spearman now and a warrior brave. There is no escape from me, and soon Athene will bring you down with my spear. Now pay the price for all my grief, for all my friends you’ve slaughtered with your blade.’</p>
<p>So saying he raised his long-shadowed spear and hurled it. But glorious Hector kept an eye on it and, crouching, dodged so the shaft flew above him, and the point buried itself in the ground behind. Yet Pallas Athene snatched it up and returned it to Achilles, too swiftly for Prince Hector to see. And Hector spoke to Peleus’ peerless son: ‘It seems you missed, godlike Achilles, despite your certainty that Zeus has doomed me. It was mere glibness of speech, mere verbal cunning, trying to unnerve me with fright, to make me lose strength and courage. You’ll get no chance to pierce my back as I flee, so, if the gods allow you, drive it through my chest as I attack, dodge my bronze spear if you can. I pray it lodges deep in your flesh! If you were dead, our greatest bane, war would be easy for us Trojans.’</p>
<p>So saying, he raised and hurled his long-shadowed spear, striking Achilles’ shield square on, though the spear simply rebounded. Hector was angered by his vain attempt with the swift shaft, and stood there in dismay, lacking a second missile. He called aloud to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Deiphobus">Deiphobus</a>&nbsp;of the White Shield, calling for his long spear, but he was nowhere to be found, and Hector realised the deceit: ‘Ah, so the gods have lured me to my death. I thought Deiphobus was by my side, but he is still in the city, Athene fooled me. An evil fate’s upon me, Death is no longer far away, and him there is no escaping. Zeus, and his son, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Far-Striker</a>, decided all this long ago, they who were once eager to defend me, and destiny now overtakes me. But let me not die without a fight, without true glory, without some deed that men unborn may hear.’</p>
<p>With this, he drew the sharp blade at his side, a powerful long-sword, and gathering his limbs together swooped like a high-soaring eagle that falls to earth from the dark clouds to seize a sick lamb or a cowering hare. So Hector swooped, brandishing his keen blade. Achilles ran to meet him heart filled with savage power, covering his chest with his great, skilfully worked shield, while above his gleaming helm with its four ridges waved the golden plumes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>&nbsp;placed thickly at its crest. Bright as the Evening Star that floats among the midnight constellations, set there the loveliest jewel in the sky, gleamed the tip of Achilles sharp spear brandished in his right hand, as he sought to work evil on noble Hector, searching for the likeliest place to land a blow on his fair flesh.</p>
<p>Now, the fine bronze armour he stripped from mighty&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;when he killed him covered all Hector’s flesh except for one opening at the throat, where the collarbones knit neck and shoulders, and violent death may come most swiftly. There, as Hector charged at him, noble Achilles aimed his ash spear, and drove its heavy bronze blade clean through the tender neck, though without cutting the windpipe or robbing Hector of the power of speech. Hector fell in the dust and Achilles shouted out in triumph: ‘While you were despoiling Patroclus, no doubt, in your folly, you thought yourself quite safe, Hector, and forgot all about me in my absence. Far from him, by the hollow ships, was a mightier man, who should have been his helper but stayed behind, and that was I, who now have brought you low. The dogs and carrion birds will tear apart your flesh, but him the Achaeans will bury.’</p>
<p></p>

<p>‘Achilles kills Hector’ - Crispijn van de Passe (I), 1613</p>
<p>Then Hector of the gleaming helm replied, in a feeble voice: ‘At your feet I beg, by your parents, by your own life, don’t let the dogs devour my flesh by the hollow ships. Accept the ransom my royal father and mother will offer, stores of gold and bronze, and let them carry my body home, so the Trojans and their wives may grant me in death my portion of fire.’</p>
<p>But fleet-footed Achilles glared at him in answer: ‘Don’t speak of my parents, dog. I wish the fury and the pain in me could drive me to carve and eat you raw for what you did, as surely as this is true: no living man will keep the dogs from gnawing at your skull, not if men weighed out twenty, thirty times your worth in ransom, and promised even more, not though Dardanian Priam bid them give your weight in gold, not even then will your royal mother lay you on a bier to grieve for you, the son she bore, rather shall dogs, and carrion birds, devour you utterly.’</p>
<p>Then Hector of the gleaming helm spoke at the point of death: ‘I know you truly now, and see your fate, nor was it mine to sway you. The heart in your breast is iron indeed. But think, lest the gods, remembering me, turn their wrath on you, that day by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ScaeanGates">Scaean</a>&nbsp;Gate when, brave as you are,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a>&nbsp;kills you, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>’s help.’</p>
<p>Death enfolded him, as he uttered these words, and, wailing its lot, his spirit fled from the body down to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>, leaving youth and manhood behind. A corpse it was that noble Achilles addressed: ‘Lie there then in death, and I will face my own, whenever Zeus and the other deathless gods decide.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246424">Bk</span><span id="BkXXII367">XXII:367-404</span> Achilles drags Hector’s corpse in the dust</h3>
<p>With this,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;drew his bronze-tipped spear from the corpse and laid it down, and as he began to strip the blood-stained armour from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s shoulders he was joined by others of the Greeks, who ran to gaze at Hector’s size and wondrous form. Yet all who approached struck the body a blow, and turning to a comrade, one said: ‘See, Hector’s easier to deal with now than when he set the ships ablaze.’ With that, he wounded the corpse.</p>
<p>When noble Achilles, the great runner, had stripped away the armour, he rose and made a speech to the Achaeans: ‘Friends, leaders, princes of the Argives, now the gods have let us kill this man, who harmed us more than all the rest together, let us make an armed reconnaissance of the city, while we see what the Trojans have in mind, whether they’ll abandon the city now their champion has fallen, or whether they’ll fight on, though Hector is no more. But why think of that? There is another corpse, unwept, unburied lying by the ships, that of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, my dear friend, whom I shall not forget as long as I walk the earth among the living. And though in the House of Hades men may forget their dead, even there I shall remember him. So, you sons of Achaea, raise the song of triumph, and drag this corpse back to the ships. We have won great glory, and killed the noble Hector, whom the Trojans prayed to like a god, in Troy.’</p>
<p>So saying, he found a way to defile the fallen prince. He pierced the tendons of both feet behind from heel to ankle, and through them threaded ox-hide thongs, tying them to his chariot, leaving the corpse’s head to trail along the ground. Then lifting the glorious armour aboard, he mounted and touched the horses with his whip, and they eagerly leapt forward. Dragged behind, Hector’s corpse raised a cloud of dust, while his outspread hair flowed, black, on either side. That head, once so fine, trailed in the dirt, now Zeus allowed his enemies to mutilate his corpse on his own native soil.</p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246425">Bk</span><span id="BkXXII405">XXII:405-515</span> The grief in Troy</h3>
<p>Seeing her son’s hair fouled with dust,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>, his mother gave a great cry, plucked the gleaming veil from her head, and tore her hair. His father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;groaned in anguish, and a wave of grief spread round them through the city, no less than if all of lofty Ilium were on fire. The old man could scarcely be restrained in his frenzy, as he made for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dardania">Dardanian</a>&nbsp;Gate. He grovelled in the dust, imploring those around, calling each man by his name: ‘Friends, let me be, despite your care. Let me go out from the city alone, to the Achaean ships. I will see if that man of violence, devoid of shame, respects old age and my weight of years. He has a father,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, as old, I think, as I am, who begot him and raised him to be a bane to Troy, though to me above all others he brings sorrow, killing so many of my sons in their prime. Yet despite my grief for the others, I mourn this one above all, with a bitter sorrow that will send me to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>’ Halls, this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>. If he could but have died in my arms! Then I and his mother, who to her sorrow bore him, could have wept and wailed our fill over his corpse.’</p>
<p>So he wept, and the people added their tears. Now, among the women, Hecabe raised loud lament: ‘My child, how wretched I am! Why should I live on in suffering now you are dead? You were my pride of Troy, night and day, a saviour, greeted as a god, by every man and women in this city, surely their great glory while you lived. But now death and fate overtake you.’</p>
<p>Hecabe wept, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Andromache">Andromache</a>, Hector’s wife, as yet knew nothing, no one had even told her that her husband had stayed outside the walls. She was at work in an inner room of the lofty palace, weaving a double-width purple tapestry, with a multicoloured pattern of flowers. In all ignorance she had asked her ladies-in-waiting to set a great cauldron on the fire so that Hector would have hot water for a bath, when he returned, never dreaming that far from all thought of baths, he had been brought low by Achilles and bright-eyed Athene. But now the cries and groans from the wall reached her, she trembled and the shuttle fell from her hand. She called to her ladies-in-waiting: ‘Two of you come with me. I must know what is happening. That was my husband’s noble mother I heard, my heart is in my mouth and my legs are numb. Some evil afflicts the House of Priam. May such news stay far from me, but I fear to my sorrow lest great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;has cut brave Hector off from the city, and quenched the fatal courage that possessed him, for he would never stay safely in the ranks, but must always charge ahead, yielding to none in daring.’</p>
<p>So saying, she ran through the halls, her heart pounding, beside herself, and her ladies followed. When they came to the wall, where the men were thronging, she rushed to the battlements and gazing out saw Hector’s corpse being hauled from the city, the powerful horses dragging it savagely towards the hollow ships. Darkness shrouded her eyes, enfolding her, and she fell backward, senseless. From her head fell the bright headdress, the frontlet and netted cap, the plaited strands, and the veil that golden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>&nbsp;had given her when Hector of the gleaming helm had led her from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#EetionAndromache">Eëtion</a>’s house, having paid a princely dowry for his bride. Her husband’s sisters and his brother’s wives crowded round her, and supported her in her dead faint.</p>
<p>When she revived and her senses returned, she lifted her voice in lament, to the women of Troy, crying: ‘Oh, Hector, alas for me! It seems we were born for this, you in Priam’s palace, here in Troy, I in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#ThebesMysia">Thebe</a>&nbsp;below wooded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Placus">Placus</a>, in Eëtion’s house. He it was who reared me from a babe, unlucky father of an ill-fated child. How I wish he’d never engendered me! Now you are gone to the House of Hades under the earth, but I remain cold with grief, a widow in your halls. And your son, the child of doomed parents, our child, a mere babe, can no longer give you joy, dead Hector: nor can you give joy to him.</p>
<p>Even if he survives this dreadful war against the Greeks, toil and suffering will be his fate, bereft of all his lands. An orphaned child is severed from his playmates; He goes about with downcast looks and tear-stained cheeks, plucks his father’s friends by the cloak or tunic, till one, from pity, holds the wine-cup to his lips, but only for a moment, enough to wet his lips but not his palate. And some lad with both parents alive strikes him with his fist and drives him from the feast, jeering at him in reproach: “Away with you, now! You’ve no father here.” So my child will run in tears to his widowed mother, my son&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Astyanax">Astyanax</a>, who sat on his father’s knee eating the rich fat and the sheep’s marrow, and when he was sleepy and tired of play, slept in his nurse’s arms in a soft bed, his dreams sweet. Now, with his dear father gone, ills will crowd on him. Astyanax, that is Lord of the City, the Trojans call him, since you Hector were the great defender of the gates and the high walls. Now by the beaked ships, far from your kin, the writhing worms will devour your corpse, once the dogs have had their fill, your naked corpse, though in your house are all the fine, finely-woven clothes that women’s hands can fashion. All those I will burn in a great fire, since you will no more wear or profit by them, as a mark of honour shown you by the men and women of Troy.’</p>
<p>So Andromache spoke, in tears, while the women joined in her lament.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Book XXIV</h2>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246511">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV1">XXIV:1-</span>76 The gods argue over the treatment of Hector’s body</h3>
<p>After the funeral games, the men left the assembly and scattered each to their own ship, ready for supper and then their fill of sweet sleep. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;wept in remembrance of his friend, and sleep that conquers all refused to come. He tossed this way and that, regretting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>’ bravery and strength, remembering all they had done together and the hardships they had shared, embroiled in war or on the cruel sea. He shed great tears, thinking of these things, lying now on his side, his back, or on his face. Each night he would stagger to his feet, at last, and wander grieving along the sand.</p>
<p>Dawn would find him there, as she lit the sea and shore. Then he would harness his swift team to his chariot, and rope&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s corpse to the rear, and when he had dragged him three times round Patroclus’ mound, return to rest in his hut, leaving Hector’s body stretched out on its face in the dust. Yet Apollo kept the flesh from being spoiled, pitying the warrior even in death, and he covered the body with his golden aegis so that Achilles could not damage the skin as he dragged the corpse along.</p>
<p>Though Achilles in his anger tried to disfigure Hector, the blessed immortals felt pity as they watched, and urged the sharp-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hermes">Hermes</a>&nbsp;to steal the corpse. Though this thought pleased most of them,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Poseidon">Poseidon</a>&nbsp;and bright-eyed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;were opposed. They still hated sacred Ilium,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;and his whole race, because of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a>&nbsp;and his foolish error, in humiliating the two goddesses, at the parade by his shepherd’s hut, when he showed his preference for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, praising her for furthering his sad lust.</p>
<p>After eleven days of this, on the twelfth dawn Phoebus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;addressed them all: ‘Harsh and cruel you are, you immortals! Did Hector not burn the thighs of unblemished bulls and goats for you, and yet you have not the decency, now he is dead, to rescue his corpse for his wife, his mother, his child to watch over, nor for his father Priam and his friends, who might then swiftly give him to the fires, and enact his funeral rites. You would rather help this brute, Achilles, whose mind is warped, his will of adamant. The man’s heart is like a lion’s, wild and powerful is that creature’s in its urge to slaughter the shepherds’ flocks for meat. Achilles is as devoid of pity, and of the shame that benefits men, urging restraint. Many a man loses someone closer to him than this, a brother born of the one mother, or a son, yet when he has finished weeping and wailing he has done, since the Fates grant men patient endurance. But this man, having robbed Hector of life, ties him to his chariot and drags him round his dead friend’s mound, as if that brought him honour or profit. Great as he is, let him be wary of our wrath; not disfigure the mute clay in his fury.’</p>
<p>But white-armed Hera took exception to all this: ‘That might make sense, Lord of the Silver Bow, if the gods valued Hector as highly as Achilles. But Hector was a mere mortal, suckled at a woman’s breast, while Achilles is child to a goddess. I nurtured her and reared her myself, and gave her in marriage to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, a warrior dear to us immortals. All of you, all you gods, came to the wedding, and you Apollo were there yourself, sitting down to feast, lyre in hand, you faithless friend of wrongdoers.’</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, the Cloud-Gatherer now replied: ‘Hera, curb your anger against us. These men will not be honoured equally. Yet of all the mortals in Ilium, Hector was dearest to the gods. At least he was so to me, never failing in his gifts towards me. My altar never lacked for sacrifice, for a share of all his meat and drink, the offerings that are our privilege. But, no talk now of stealing brave Hector’s corpse, for Achilles would hear of it from his mother who visits him night and day. Better for one of you to summon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a> to me, so I may advise her wisely, to have Achilles accept a ransom, and give Hector’s body back to Priam.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246512">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV77">XXIV:77-140</span> Thetis persuades Achilles to ransom the corpse</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iris">Iris</a>&nbsp;it was, swift as the storm-wind, who sped off to carry the message, and half-way between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Samothrace">Samothrace</a>&nbsp;and rugged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Imbros">Imbros</a>&nbsp;plunged into the dark echoing waters. Down she sank like the fisherman’s lead weight set in a piece of ox-horn that lures the greedy fish to their death. In a hollow cave she found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">Thetis</a>, surrounded by the nymphs of the sea, bemoaning the destiny of her peerless son, doomed to die in the fertile land of Troy, far from his native soil. Fleet-footed Iris approached and spoke: ‘Come, Thetis,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;of deathless wisdom summons you.’ ‘Why does the great god ask for me?’ the silver-footed goddess replied, ‘I’m possessed by such deep sorrow, I’d be ashamed to join the immortals, yet I will go, for anything he says must carry weight.’</p>
<p>With that, the lovely goddess donned a dark veil, blacker than black, and followed Iris, swift as the wind. The deep sea parted for them, and when they reached the shore they soared to the heavens, and found far-echoing Zeus surrounded by all the blessed immortals.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Athene">Athene</a>&nbsp;gave up her place next to the son of Cronos, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hera">Hera</a>&nbsp;handed her a fine golden cup, and welcomed her sweetly, and Thetis drank and gave her back the cup. Then the Father of gods and men addressed her: ‘Lady Thetis you come, I know, bearing the burden of sorrowful thought, yet I must tell you why I summoned you. The immortals have been quarrelling these nine days about how&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s corpse is treated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, sacker of cities. They would like Hermes to spirit the body away, but I would rather honour Achilles, and keep your love and respect in time to come. So dart down to his camp and tell him what I say, that he has angered the gods, and I above all am filled with wrath, because he holds Hector’s corpse by the beaked ships, instead of restoring it to Troy. Hopefully, in fear of me, he will return the body, but I will send Iris to brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>, and tell him to go to the Greek ships and offer a ransom for his son, gifts that will thaw the heart of Achilles.’</p>
<p>The goddess, silver-footed Thetis, instantly obeyed, darting down from the heights of Olympus to her son’s hut. There she found him still grieving, while his friends prepared their morning meal. The carcase of a great shaggy ram lay there, awaiting their attention, in the hut. His regal mother sat down beside him and stroking him with her hand said: ‘Child, how long must you consume your heart with tears and sorrow, forgetting your food and bed? Why not find comfort with some woman, since you have but a brief time left to live, and the shadows of Death and remorseless Fate are already close upon you. Obey me swiftly now.’ And she gave him Zeus’ message, to release Hector’s corpse and take a ransom in exchange.</p>
<p>Fleet-footed Achilles gazed at her and answered: ‘If such be the Olympian’s firm wish, then let it be so. Let whoever brings fit ransom take away the dead.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246513">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV141">XXIV:141-199</span> Iris carries the message to Priam</h3>
<p>While mother and son were exchanging winged words there by the ships,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;sent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Iris">Iris</a>&nbsp;to sacred Ilium: ‘Down from Olympus, Iris, fast as you can, and tell brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;in Troy to go to the Greek ships and ransom his dear son’s body, carrying gifts to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;that will thaw his heart. Tell him to go alone, not to take anyone else from Troy except one of the older heralds, to drive the light mule-cart that will carry Achilles’ victim back to the city. Tell him not to fear death or anything else, for we will grant him the best of guides, Hermes, who will escort him to Achilles. Once in Achilles’ hut, no one will harm him, for he will not find Achilles witless, mindless, vicious, but one who will in kindness spare the suppliant.’</p>
<p>Those were his words, and Iris, swift as the storm-wind, sped away with the message. She came to Priam’s palace and found it filled with grief and lamentation. Around their father his sons sat, their garments drenched with tears. There in the middle of the courtyard was the aged king wrapped in a cloak, his head and neck soiled by the earth from his hands as he grovelled on the ground. Throughout the palace his daughters and daughters-in-law were bemoaning the host of noble warriors who had lost their lives at Greek hands.</p>
<p>Iris, Zeus’ messenger, came to Priam and said: ‘Take heart, Dardanian Priam, forgo all fear. I am here not as a herald of evil but with the best of intent. I come with a message from Zeus, who far off though he may be still cares about you and has pity.’ Then she repeated Zeus’ wishes, and departed.</p>
<p>Then Priam ordered his sons to harness the light mule-cart, with a wicker frame on top. He himself went down to his vaulted treasure chamber, high-roofed and fragrant with cedar-wood, which was full of precious things. He summoned his wife&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>, and said: ‘Lady, a message from Zeus has come to me, telling me to go to the Greek ships and ransom our dear son’s body, with gifts that will thaw Achilles’ heart. I feel compelled to go to the Greek camp, to their ships, but tell me what you think.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246514">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV200">XXIV:200-280</span> Priam prepares to visit the Greek camp</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>&nbsp;cried out at his words, and said: ‘Alas, where is that wisdom now for which you are famous here and abroad? How can you go to the Greek ships and face the man who has slaughtered so many of your fine sons? Your heart must be made of iron. Once you are in his power, from the moment he sets eyes on you, that savage treacherous brute will show you neither mercy nor respect. Let us grieve for our son here, in the hall. This is the thread Fate spun for that child of mine at his birth, to sate the running dogs far from us, his corpse held captive by that man of violence. I wish I could fix my teeth in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>’ heart and devour it. That would requite him for what he has done to my son, who showed he was no coward when he was killed, fighting to defend the men and the full-breasted women of Troy, without thought of flight or safety.’</p>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>, that godlike old man, answered her: ‘Don’t try to prevent me going, I will not be persuaded, and don’t you prove a bird of ill-omen here. If any man on earth had spoken to me of this, even a priest, or some diviner who reads the sacrificial entrails, I would have thought it false, and rejected it the more. But I heard the voice of a goddess, and saw her face to face, so I must go, and fulfil her command. If I am doomed to die by the ships of the bronze-clad Greeks, then so be it. When I have clasped my son in my arms and wept my fill, then let Achilles slay me on the spot.’</p>
<p>So saying, he lifted the ornate lids of several chests from which he took twelve fine robes, and twelve single-sided cloaks, with as many coverlets, white mantles and tunics also. He weighed out ten talents of gold and had them taken outside, with two bright tripods, and four cauldrons. And he even added a great treasure, a beautiful cup, a gift from the men of Thrace when he went on an embassy there, so eager was he to ransom his dear son fittingly. Then he drove out the Trojans cluttering the portico, rebuking them with harsh words: ‘Out you shameful wretches! Have you nothing to grieve for at home that you come to trouble me? Is it not enough that Zeus has brought me sorrow; taking from me the best of sons? You will soon know it too. You’ll be easy meat for the Greeks now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>&nbsp;is dead. As for me, I only hope I go to the House of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>&nbsp;before I have to see this city plundered and laid waste.’</p>
<p>With this, he chased after them with his staff, and they fled from the angry old man. He shouted reproaches at his sons as well,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#HelenusPriam">Helenus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a>, noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agathon">Agathon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pammon">Pammon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Antiphonus">Antiphonus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polites">Polites</a>&nbsp;of the loud war-cry,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Deiphobus">Deiphobus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#HippothousPriam">Hippothous</a>, and lordly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Dius">Dius</a>. He ordered all nine around at the top of his voice: ‘Quick, you useless tribe, my disgrace: would that instead of Hector you were the ones who had died by the swift ships! Alas, my wretched fate! I had the best sons in all the wide land of Troy, yet they are gone, every one; godlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Mestor">Mestor</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Troilus">Troilus</a>&nbsp;the fierce charioteer, and now Hector, a god among men, who seemed the son of a divine being, not of this mere mortal. War has taken them all, while you shameful creatures remain, liars and wastrels, better at treading the dust in dance, or stealing lambs and kids from the fields. Make ready the cart, now, and pile these things inside, so I can be on my way.’</p>
<p>So he ranted, and they, fearful of their father’s anger, brought out the light mule cart, new and carefully-made, and added the wicker frame on top. They took the boxwood yoke with its central boss and fine guide rings from its peg, and carried it out with its twelve foot yoke-band. They set the yoke carefully on the polished shaft, in the notch at the end, and slipped the ring over the pin. Then they bound it fast to the boss with three turns either way, then wound it round the shaft and tucked the loose end in. They carried the princely ransom for Hector’s corpse from the treasure chamber, and heaped the items on the wooden cart. Then they yoked the sturdy mules, trained to work in harness, a glorious gift to Priam from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Mysians">Mysians</a>. Last of all they brought, and yoked to his chariot, horses kept by the king himself and fed at the gleaming manger.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246515">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV281">XXIV:281-348</span> Priam prays to Zeus</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;and the herald were waiting, lost in thought, in the lofty palace, for their teams to be harnessed, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>&nbsp;came to them, full of anxiety, carrying a golden cup of honeyed wine in her right hand, so they might make libation before they set out. She approached the chariot saying: ‘There, pour a libation to Father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>&nbsp;and pray for your safe return from the enemy camp, since your heart persuades you to go despite my misgivings. Pray to the son of Cronus, Lord of the Storm-Clouds, God of Ida, who gazes down on our whole land of Troy, and ask him to send a bird of omen, and make it that swift messenger, dearest to him of all the birds, and mightiest. Let it appear on your right hand, so you can note it and feel safe in going among the horse-loving Danaans. If Zeus does not grant you a sight of his swift messenger, then I’d not advise you to visit the Argive ships, no matter how you feel.’</p>
<p>‘Wife,’ Priam replied, ‘I will do as you suggest, for it is good to pray to Zeus, and ask him for mercy.’</p>
<p>So saying the old man asked a maid to pour fresh water over his hands. She brought a pitcher of water and a basin, and when he had washed his hands, he took the cup from his wife and standing in the centre of the courtyard, he poured the wine, then gazed towards heaven and prayed aloud: ‘Glorious and almighty Father Zeus, who rules from Ida, let me be welcome in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>’ hut and may he show mercy. Send me a bird of omen, that swift messenger, dearest to you of all the birds, and mightiest. Let it appear on my right hand, so I can note it and feel safe in going among the horse-loving Danaans.’</p>
<p>Zeus, the Counsellor, heard his prayer, and sent the greatest of winged omens: the dark raptor men call the black eagle. Its wingspan was as wide as the double doors, strong and secure, of a rich man’s lofty treasure chamber, and it soared on the right, high over the city. They were overjoyed at a sight that warmed the hearts of all.</p>
<p>The old man quickly mounted the chariot, and drove from the echoing portico out through the palace gate. The mules in front pulled the cart driven by wise&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#IdaeusHerald">Idaeus</a>, while the old man’s team followed. He cracked his whip as they sped through the city, while his folk followed after, wailing as if he went to his death. But when they had left the city and entered the plain, his sons and sons-in-law turned back to Ilium.</p>
<p>The pair did not escape Zeus, the Far-Echoer’s, notice, as they forged across the plain, and pitying the old man he spoke at once to his dear son&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hermes">Hermes</a>: ‘You love to guide travellers, and give ear to whomever you wish, so go and escort Priam to the hollow ships of the Greeks, so that no one knows him till he reaches Achilles.’</p>
<p>At this, the Messenger God, the Slayer of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Argus">Argus</a>, quick to obey, bound his beautiful sandals on his feet, the sandals of imperishable gold that carry him swift as the gale over the ocean waves and the boundless earth. He took with him that wand with which he lulls to sleep or rouses from slumber whomsoever he will. He flew with it in his hand, and soon came to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hellespont">Hellespont</a> and Troy. There he appeared in the likeness of a young prince at that age when a beard first starts to grow, and youth’s charms are at their greatest.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246516">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV349">XXIV:349-467</span> Hermes guides Priam to Achilles hut</h3>
<p>When the pair had passed the great barrow of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#IlusTroy">Ilus</a>, they halted the mules and the horses by the river to drink. It was twilight now, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hermes">Hermes</a>&nbsp;was close before the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#IdaeusHerald">herald</a>&nbsp;saw him. Turning to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;he said: ‘Take care, Dardanian Priam, here is something that calls for caution. There’s a man in sight who will butcher us, it seems to me. Let’s flee in the chariot, or we’ll have to fall at his feet and hope for mercy.’</p>
<p>At this the old man’s hair stood on end, and his mind filled with fear and confusion. But as he stood there in a daze, the Helper went straight to the old man and took his hand, and asked him: ‘Father, where are you off to, with your mules and horses, through the sacred night, when ordinary mortals sleep? Do you not fear the Greeks and their fury, an enemy without shame, close by? What would you do if one of them saw you carrying treasure through the swiftly darkening night? You are neither of you young enough to ward off some youngster’s attack. I am no threat to you, however, and I will be your defence, since to me you are the very image of my own father.’</p>
<p>Godlike Priam, the aged king, replied: ‘Dear son, it is as you say. Yet some god has extended his hand above me, since he sends a traveller such as you to meet me, a fine omen, for you are of marvellous beauty and stature, and wise beyond your years. Happy are the parents from whom you spring.’</p>
<p>‘Indeed, Sir,’ Hermes answered, ‘it may be so. But tell me truly, do you carry this heap of noble treasure to safety in some foreign part, or are you all fleeing Troy in fear, having the lost the best of warriors, your fine son, who never ceased to fight the Achaeans?’</p>
<p>Godlike Priam replied: ‘Who are you, noble youth? Who are your parents? You speak so eloquently of my unfortunate son.’</p>
<p>The Messenger God, the Slayer of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Argus">Argus</a>, answered: ‘You are testing me, I see, my venerable lord, in asking about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>. I have often seen him in battle, where glory is won. I saw him killing Argives when he drove them to the ships, cutting men down with the sharp bronze, and we stood there dumbfounded, for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;held us back, in his wrath against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>. I am Achilles’ squire, who sailed here with him, one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>, the son of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Polyctor">Polyctor</a>. He is wealthy, an old man like you, with six sons, and I a seventh. We cast lots and I was chosen to follow Achilles. Tonight I am scouting the plain, since at dawn the bright-eyed Achaeans will battle for the city. They are tired of sitting idle, and Agamemnon can no longer restrain them in their eagerness for war.’</p>
<p>Godlike Priam, the aged king, replied: ‘If you are truly Achilles’ squire, tell me this. Is my son’s body still by the ships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb and scattered him to the dogs?’</p>
<p>Again the Slayer of Argus answered: ‘The dogs and carrion birds have not devoured him yet, my venerable lord, and his corpse still lies by Achilles’ ship among the huts as before. He has lain there twelve days now, but his flesh has not decayed, nor do the worms that feed on war dead consume him. It is true that ruthless Achilles drags his body round his dear comrade’s barrow, every dawn, yet he cannot harm him. You would marvel if you came and saw him, fresh as dew, washed clean of blood, without a stain upon him, and all his wounds are closed, wherever the host of bronze blades struck him. So do the blessed gods care for his corpse: for he was dear to them.’</p>
<p>The old man’s mind was eased to hear this, saying: ‘My child, it is good to give the immortals all that is due to them, for in my halls my son, as surely as he lived, never forgot the gods who hold Olympus, and they have now remembered him, even though he has met his doom. Come take this fine goblet, and protect me and see me safe at Achilles’ hut, with the blessing of the gods.’</p>
<p>The Messenger God, the Slayer of Argus, spoke once more: ‘Ah, my venerable lord, because I am young you test me, but you cannot tempt me to take a gift without Achilles’ knowledge. I respect him deeply, and fear to rob him of what should be his, lest evil later befalls me. Yet I would guide you to glorious Argos, and wait on you with kind attention as we travel on foot or aboard ship, and no one would dare attack you on seeing your guide.’</p>
<p>With that the Helper leapt into the chariot, seized the whip and reins, and breathed fresh strength into the horses and mules. When they came to the trench and wall defending the ships, the guards were preparing their meal, and the Slayer of Argus shed sleep around them, thrust back the bars, and opened the gates, and drove Priam through them with the cart and his gifts.</p>
<p>They came to Achilles’ hut, a high-roofed hut the Myrmidons built for their prince, with beams cut from the fir trees. They had thatched it with meadow rushes, and fenced it with stakes, close-set to make a courtyard. The gate to the yard was held by a single fir-wood bar that needed three Myrmidons to drive it home or draw it back, though Achilles could do so alone. This gate Hermes the Helper opened for the aged king, ahead of the glorious gifts destined for fleet-footed Achilles. Then he stepped down from the chariot saying: ‘Venerable lord, my Father sent me to guide you on your way. You have been visited by an immortal god, for I am Hermes. Now I must leave you and return, and not be seen by Achilles, for it would be wrong for a god to be entertained openly by a mortal man. But you must go in, and clasp his knees, and invoke his father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>, and his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">mother</a>, of the shining tresses, and his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Neoptolemus">child</a>, and so move his heart.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246517">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV468">XXIV:468-551</span> Priam moves Achilles’ heart</h3>
<p>With that,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hermes">Hermes</a>&nbsp;left for high Olympus, while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;climbed down from his chariot, leaving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#IdaeusHerald">Idaeus</a>&nbsp;to handle the horses and mules. The old king went straight to the hut frequented by Zeus-beloved&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>. He found him there, with only the warrior&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a>&nbsp;and warlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Alcimus">Alcimus</a>&nbsp;of all his friends. They were busy attending to his meal. The table stood at his side but he had finished eating and drinking. Great Priam slipped in unobserved, and reaching Achilles, clasped his knees, and kissed his hands, the fearful, man-killing hands that had slaughtered so many of his sons. Achilles was astonished at the sight of godlike Priam, as were his friends. They stared at each other, astounded, as men do in the hall of a wealthy nobleman, when a stranger, who has murdered a man in a moment of frenzy in his own country, seeking refuge abroad, bursts in on them.</p>
<p>But Priam was already entreating Achilles: ‘Godlike Achilles, think of your own father, who is of my generation, and so is likewise on the sad threshold of old age. Perhaps his neighbours are troubling him, and there is no one to protect him from harm, or ward off ruin. But he at least can rejoice in the knowledge that you live, and each day brings the hope of seeing you return from Troy. While I, I am a victim of sad fate. Of the best of my sons, the best in all of Troy, not one is left. Fifty sons I had, when you Achaeans landed, nineteen by the one wife, and the rest by other ladies of my court. Most of them have fallen in furious battle, and the defender of the city and its people, my prime recourse, Hector, you have killed, as he fought for his country. I come now to the ships to beg his corpse from you, bringing a princely ransom. Respect the gods, Achilles, and show mercy towards me, remembering your own father, for I am more to be pitied than he, since I have brought myself to do what no other man on earth would do, I have lifted to my lips the hand of the man who killed my sons.’</p>

<p>‘Priam pleads for Hector's body’ - Workshop of Bernard Picart, 1710</p>
<p>His words had moved Achilles to tears at the thought of his own father, and taking the old man’s hands he set him gently from him, while both were lost in memory. Priam remembered man-killing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, and wept aloud, at Achilles’ feet, while Achilles wept for his father&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Peleus">Peleus</a>&nbsp;and for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>&nbsp;once more, and the sound of their lament filled the hut.</p>
<p>But when Achilles was sated with weeping, and the force of grief was spent, he rose instantly from his chair, and raising the old king by his arm, he took pity on his grey beard and hair, and spoke eloquently to him: ‘You are indeed unfortunate, and your heart has endured much sorrow. Surely, though, there is iron in your spirit, daring to come alone to our ships, and face the man who slew so many of your noble sons? Come, sit here, and we will shut away our sorrows, despite our grief, since there is but cold comfort in lament. The gods have spun the thread of fate for wretched mortals: we live in sorrow, while they are free from care. Two urns stand in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>’ palace containing the experiences he grants mortals, one holds blessings, the other ills. Those who receive a mixture of the two meet with good and ill, but those whom the Thunderer only serves from the jar of ills becomes an outcast, driven over the face of the earth by despair, a wanderer honoured neither by gods nor men. See how the gods showered glorious gifts on my father Peleus, from the moment of his birth, wealth and possessions beyond other men, kingship of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>, and though but a mortal man, a goddess for a wife. Yet some god brought evil even to him, no crowd of princes, but an only son doomed to an untimely end. He receives no care from me, since I sit here in theland of Troy, far from my own country, bringing harm to you and your children. And you, my aged lord, they say you once were happy, renowned for your wealth and your sons, in all the lands, from the isle of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lesbos">Lesbos</a>, where&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Macar">Macar</a>&nbsp;reigned, through upper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Phrygia">Phrygia</a>&nbsp;to the boundless&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hellespont">Hellespont</a>. But from the moment that the heavenly gods brought this wretched war upon you, all has turned to battle and slaughter. Endure, let your heart not grieve forever, Sorrowing for your son will achieve nothing, you’ll not bring him back to life, though life will bring you other sorrows.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246518">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV552">XXIV:552-620</span> Achilles releases Hector’s corpse to Priam</h3>
<p>‘Do not ask me to sit down, beloved of Zeus,’ replied the aged king, ‘while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s corpse lies neglected by the huts, but give him back to me swiftly so my eyes can gaze on him, and accept the ransom, the princely ransom, I bring. May you have joy of it, and return to your native land, since you have shown me mercy from the first.’</p>
<p>Fleet-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>, frowning answered him; ‘I need no urging, old man. I have decided to return Hector’s body to you. My own&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Thetis">mother</a>, the daughter of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nereus">Old Man</a>&nbsp;of the Sea, brought me a message from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>. And I know in my heart, such things don’t escape me, that some god led you to our swift ships. No mortal man, not even a strong young warrior, would dare to venture into this camp, nor having done so elude the guards, nor shift the bar across the gate. So don’t try to move my heart further, lest I defy Zeus’ command and choose, suppliant though you are, not to spare even you.’</p>
<p>The old king, gripped by fear, was silent. Then the son of Peleus ran from the hut, followed by his two companions,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Alcimus">Alcimus</a>, the dearest of his friends after dead Patroclus. They un-harnessed the mules and horses, brought in the old king’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#IdaeusHerald">herald</a>, his crier, and offered him a chair. Then from the well-made cart they lifted down the princely ransom for Hector’s body. They left there two white cloaks and a fine tunic, so that the corpse could be wrapped in them, before he gave it back to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;to take home. Achilles then summoned two servant-girls and ordered them to wash and anoint the body, first carrying it to a place where Priam could not see his son, lest his grief at the sight provoke his anger and Achilles be angered in reply, and kill him in defiance of Zeus’ command. When the servant-girls had done washing the body and anointing it with oil, and had dressed it in the fine tunic and wrapped it in a cloak, Achilles himself placed it on a bier, and he and his comrades lifted it into the wooden cart. Then he sighed and called his dead friend by name: ‘<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, do not be angered, if even in the House of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hades">Hades</a>&nbsp;you learn that I have returned noble Hector to his dear father, who has given a princely ransom. Even of that you shall have your rightful share.’</p>
<p>With this, noble Achilles returned to the hut and sat down again on his richly inlaid chair opposite Priam, saying: ‘Venerable lord, your son’s body has been placed on a bier and I shall release it to you as you wished. At dawn you may look on him, and carry him back, but now let us eat. Even long-haired&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Niobe">Niobe</a>&nbsp;eventually thought to eat, though her twelve children had been slain, six daughters, six sons in their prime.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;angry that Niobe had boasted of bearing so many children compared with Leto who had borne but two, killed the sons with arrows from his silver bow, while his sister&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Artemis">Artemis</a>&nbsp;killed the daughters. The pair slew them all, and left them lying in their blood, for nine days, since Zeus had turned the people to stone and there was no one to bury the corpses. On the tenth day the heavenly gods gave them burial, and only then did Niobe, exhausted by her grief, take sustenance. Now, turned to stone herself, she stands among the crags on the desolate slopes of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Sipylus">Sipylus</a>, where men say the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Nymphs">Nymphs</a>&nbsp;that dance on the banks of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#AchelousPhrygian">Achelous</a> take their rest, and broods on the sorrows the gods sent her. Come let us too take sustenance, venerable lord: in Ilium you can lament your son once more, and grieve for him with a flood of tears.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246519">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV621">XXIV:621-676</span> Achilles agrees a truce for Hector’s funeral</h3>
<p>Swift&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;sprang to his feet, and went and slaughtered a white-fleeced sheep, which his men flayed and prepared. They chopped it deftly, spitted the pieces, roasted them carefully, and then drew them from the spits.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Automedon">Automedon</a>&nbsp;set out bread in neat baskets, while Achilles served the meat, and they helped themselves to the good things placed before them.</p>
<p>When they had sated their hunger and thirst, Dardanian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;contemplated Achilles and how marvellously tall and handsome he was, the very image of a god. Achilles too marvelled, at Priam’s nobility and eloquence. When they had gazed at each other to their heart’s content, godlike king Priam said: ‘Beloved of Zeus, show me to my bed now, so that, lulled by sweet sleep, we may find ease in rest. My eyes have not closed since my son lost his life at your hands. Then I lamented and brooded over my endless sorrows, and grovelled in the dirt in my courtyard. Now I have tasted food and wetted my throat with red wine, who until now tasted nothing.’</p>
<p>Now Achilles ordered his friends and the servant-girls to set up bedsteads in the portico, cover them with fine purple blankets, and spread sheets above, and fleecy mantles on top to keep the guests warm. Torch in hand, the girls left the room and swiftly busied themselves at the task. Then fleet-footed Achilles spoke to Priam in a cooler tone: ‘You must sleep outside, venerable lord, in case one of the countless counsellors of the Achaeans comes to sit and talk with me, as is right. If he saw you, in the swift passage of darkness, he might hasten to King&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, and then the return of the corpse to you would be delayed. Now, tell me truly, how long do you need for noble&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s funeral. I will keep truce myself for that length of time, and restrain the army.’</p>
<p>The godlike old king answered him: ‘You would be doing me a great kindness Achilles, if you indeed allow me time to bury Hector. You know the city is surrounded, and the Trojans would fear to fetch wood from the far hills, otherwise. We will lament him nine days in the palace, and carry out the rites on the tenth. Then on the eleventh day we will raise his barrow, and the people feast. If we must, we will fight again on the twelfth.’</p>
<p>Fleet-footed Achilles replied: ‘It shall be as you say, aged Priam, and I will restrain the army for that length of time.’</p>
<p>With that, he clasped the old man’s right wrist, to reassure him. Then Priam and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#IdaeusHerald">Idaeus</a>&nbsp;the herald lay down to sleep in the portico, their minds still full of thoughts, while Achilles slept in the inner recess of his well-built hut, with the lovely&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Briseis">Briseis</a> by his side.</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246520">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV677">XXIV:677-717</span> Priam returns to Troy with the body</h3>
<p>Gods and warriors, overcome by sleep, passed the night in slumber, but not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hermes">Hermes</a>&nbsp;the Helper, who was awake considering how to lead&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>&nbsp;from the ships, without being challenged by the trusty guards at the gate. Finally, standing at the head of Priam’s bed, he spoke to him: ‘Aged lord, now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;has spared you, it seems that though still ringed with enemies, you sleep without a care. You have ransomed your son for a princely sum, but the one your sons will need to give will be three times as great, if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Agamemnon">Atreides</a>&nbsp;or one of his warriors finds you here.’</p>
<p>The old man woke, in fear, and roused the herald. Hermes harnessed the mules and horses, and undetected by their enemies, drove them quietly through the camp himself. As saffron-robed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eos">Dawn</a>&nbsp;lit the wide earth, they reached the ford of eddying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Scamander">Xanthus</a>, that noble river begotten by immortal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Zeus">Zeus</a>, and Hermes left them for high Olympus. Lamenting and in tears the two men drove, Priam the chariot and horses,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#IdaeusHerald">Idaeus</a>&nbsp;the mule-cart carrying the bier. No one in Troy, man or woman, knew anything of them till&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Cassandra">Cassandra</a>, lovely as golden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, from the heights of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Pergamus">Pergamus</a>, saw her dear father driving the chariot, and the herald, the city crier, driving the mule-cart, and saw who lay there on the bier. She gave a loud cry, and called to the city below: ‘Men and women of Troy, if ever you rejoiced when Hector returned from battle, come now and gaze on him, who brought joy beyond compare to the city and its people.’</p>
<p>Soon the city emptied. Plunged in unbearable grief, all ran to the gate, and close beyond them met Priam, bringing home his dead.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>’s beloved&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Andromache">wife</a>&nbsp;and royal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">mother</a> flung themselves at the cart. Clasping Hector’s head, they wailed and tore their hair, while the great host of people wept. And they’d have been there, outside the gate, lamenting him the livelong day till the setting of the sun, if old Priam had not called out to them from the chariot: ‘Let the mules pass, and when I have brought him to the palace then you can take your fill of lament.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246521">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV718">XXIV:718-775</span> The lament for Hector</h3>
<p>At&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>’s request, the crowd parted and made way for the cart. The family led the way to the royal palace, and there they laid the body on a wooden bed, and summoned the chorus of singers to stand beside it, to sing the dirges and lead the lamentation, while the women wailed in chorus. White-armed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Andromache">Andromache</a>&nbsp;made the first lament, cradling the head of man-killing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>: ‘Husband, you have died too young, leaving me a widow in the palace, and your son, whom we his unhappy parents brought into the world, is still a babe who I fear will never grow to manhood. For this city is doomed to perish utterly, as you have perished who watched over it, and kept its wives and children safe, who will soon be captive aboard the hollow ships, I among them. You my child will go with me, and labour somewhere at menial tasks for some harsh master. Or worse perhaps, some Greek will seize you by the arm and hurl you from the wall to your death, angered perhaps because Hector killed his brother, father, son, for many are the Achaeans whose mouths have bit the dust at the hands of Hector, and your father was not a kindly man in battle. Now the people lament you throughout the city, Hector, and unspeakable grief your death has brought your parents. The bitterest grief of all is mine, because you did not die in your bed, stretching out your arms to me, with some tender word that I might have treasured, in tears, night and day.’</p>
<p>Such was her lament, and the women added their grief to hers. Now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hecabe">Hecabe</a>&nbsp;took up the impassioned dirge: ‘Hector, dearest to me of all my children, dear to the gods when you were alive, who care for you now therefore in death. Swift-footed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;robbed me of other sons, selling them beyond the restless sea in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexRSTUWXZ.php#Samothrace">Samothrace</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Imbros">Imbros</a>&nbsp;or in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Lemnos">Lemnos</a>&nbsp;veiled in smoke. You he killed with the sharp bronze and dragged you round his friend&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Patroclus">Patroclus</a>’ barrow, whom you slew, not that he raised him from the dead by doing so, and yet you lie here fresh as dew, as if newly dead, like one whom&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Apollo">Apollo</a>&nbsp;of the Silver Bow has touched and killed with his gentlest dart.’</p>
<p>So she lamented, and stirred endless grief. Now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Helen">Helen</a>&nbsp;followed with a third lament: ‘Handsome Hector, dearest to me of all my Trojan brothers! Godlike&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Paris">Paris</a>, my husband, brought me to this land of Troy, though I’d rather I had died there and then, and this is now the twentieth year since I abandoned my native country, yet in all that time I had no harsh or spiteful word from you. If any in the palace reproached me, your brothers, sisters, your brother’s fine wives, or your mother, for your father was ever gentle to me like my own, you would turn away their wrath, and restrain them with gentle acts and words. So I grieve aloud for you, and in my heart for my wretched self, since there is no one else in all wide Troy who’ll be kind or gentle to me, all of them shudder as I pass.’</p>
<h3><span id="anchor_Toc239246522">Bk</span><span id="BkXXIV776">XXIV:776-804</span> Hector’s funeral</h3>
<p>So&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Helen">Helen</a>&nbsp;lamented, and the whole crowd wept. But the old king,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexOP.php#Priam">Priam</a>, gave his orders: ‘Gather wood now, men of Troy, and bring it to the city, and have no fear of some crafty ambush by the Greeks.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexA.php#Achilles">Achilles</a>&nbsp;promised me, before I left the black ships, that he would restrain their army till the twelfth dawn comes.’</p>
<p>So they harnessed oxen and mules to the wagons, and assembled outside the city. For nine days they gathered huge piles of logs, and when the tenth dawn brought light to mortals they carried brave&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexFGHILMN.php#Hector">Hector</a>, and, in tears, laid his body on the summit of the pyre and set the wood ablaze.</p>
<p>Next day, when rosy-fingered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/IlindexBCDE.php#Eos">Dawn</a>&nbsp;appeared, the people gathered at glorious Hector’s pyre. Then when all had assembled they worked together, quenching the embers with red wine, wherever the fire had reached. Then Hector’s brothers and his friends collected his ashes, still mourning him, their cheeks wet with tears. They placed the ashes, wrapped in a purple robe, inside a golden urn, and laid the urn in a hollow grave, covering it with large close-set stones. Then over it they piled the barrow, posting sentinels on every side, lest the bronze-greaved Greeks attacked them before the promised time. When they had heaped the mound, they returned to Troy, and gathered in Zeus-beloved Priam’s palace for the glorious funeral feast appointed.</p>
<p>And such were the funeral rites of Hector, tamer of horses.</p>
