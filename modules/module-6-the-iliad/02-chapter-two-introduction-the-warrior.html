            </header>

            <article class="prose">
                <p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>n cultural anthropology, the distinction between a guilt society, an
                    honor/shame society, and a fear society has been used to categorize different cultures. For the
                    purposes of this chapter, we will only discuss the guilt and honor/shame societies, however.</p>

                <p> These different types of societies are called Cultural Areas, or broad areas of the globe where
                    social patterns have developed over millennia and share common social patterns. Culture Areas occur
                    because the people in those regions are in some measure responding to a similar environment. These
                    differences can apply to how behavior is governed concerning government, business, the rule of law,
                    and social etiquette. Cultural classifications get their namesake from the emotions that are
                    predominantly used to control an individual and maintain the social order by swaying them into
                    obedience and conformity.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>Guilt vs. Shame</strong>
                    <p><strong>Guilt</strong> is the core emotion behind one’s adherence to societal rules and standards
                        in a guilt society.</p>
                    <p><strong>Honor and Shame</strong> are the major motivating forces underlying socially applauded
                        and norm-conforming behavior in an honor society.</p>
                    <p>Although guilt and shame are often used interchangeably, they refer to very different
                        psychological experiences. The feeling of guilt arises when we violate our own moral standards
                        and conscience; it reflects how we feel about ourselves. Honor and shame, on the other hand,
                        often result from the judgment of one’s action, appearance, or behavior against the norms and
                        standards of the society/culture of which they are a part.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Guilt Society</h3>
                <p>In a guilt society, control is maintained by creating, and continually reinforcing, the feeling of
                    guilt for certain condemned behaviors.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are from what is often referred to as the "Western culture," which by transference and
                        immigration includes much of modern North America and Northern Europe now. Northern Europeans
                        and North Americans are classified under Western culture due to high commonality of cultural
                        values and patterns among them. The Western culture that many of us have lived in our entire
                        lives is a guilt culture.</li>
                    <li>The guilt/innocence worldview focuses on law and punishment. A person in this type of culture
                        may ask, “is my behavior fair or unfair?” This type of culture also emphasizes individual
                        conscience.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    "Wergild primarily served to prevent cycles of revenge and bring social harmony by providing
                    compensation for the life taken."
                </div>

                <h3>Honor & Shame Society</h3>
                <p>Many of the texts we have studied already (Works and Days, Gilgamesh), the leading text for this
                    chapter (The Iliad), many from the third chapter (Medea, Lysistrata, Arabian Nights), and even The
                    Bible, originate in what some call the Mediterranean Culture Area. The Mediterranean Culture Area
                    resembles an honor and shame society rather than one built on guilt.</p>

                <p>In an honor society, the means of control are the implication of shame and the complementary threat
                    of ostracism. When shame is applied to a subject of this worldview, they often seek balance, which
                    can lead to revenge dynamics. A person in this type of culture may ask, “shall I look ashamed if I
                    do X,” or “how will people look at me if I do Y”? Shame cultures are typically based on the concepts
                    of pride, honor, and appearances.</p>

                <h3>Achilles in Vietnam</h3>
                <p>In his book <em>Achilles in Vietnam</em>, clinical psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Shay makes the
                    connection to the honor-based cultures of Homeric Greece to our modern military, where honor codes,
                    morality, and hierarchy are still closely tied together. This will be our inroads for understanding
                    the ancient warrior and his or her way of life in a meaningful way.</p>

                <p>We will be borrowing the following concepts from Dr. Shay for this purpose:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the Betrayal of What is Right</li>
                    <li>the Shrinkage of Moral Horizons</li>
                    <li>the Death of a Special Comrade</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>Betrayal of What is Right</strong>
                    <p>Dr. Shay opens his chapter on the Betrayal of “What is Right” by saying, “We begin in the moral
                        world of the soldier—what his culture understands to be right—and betrayal of that moral order
                        by a commander” (3).</p>
                    <p>It is through the Iliad and Achilles that we will explore this notion of betrayal of what is
                        right. The Iliad demonstrates how “when a leader destroys the legitimacy of the army’s moral
                        and devastatingly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout" style="background: var(--bg-secondary); border-left-color: #e74c3c;">
                    <strong>The Rage of the Warrior</strong>
                    <p> The first word of the <em>Iliad</em> is <em>menin</em> (Rage). It is the central theme of the
                        poem.
                    </p>
                    <p>In <em>Attack on Titan</em>, Erwin Smith commands his soldiers to rage against the "cruelty of
                        this world," echoing the ancient warrior's response to the inevitability of death and betrayal:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote
                        style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #e74c3c; font-style: italic;">
                        "My soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world! My soldiers push
                        forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers RAGE!"
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This "rage" is not just anger; it is an assertion of existence and will against a universe (or a
                        commander) that seeks to crush or devalue them. It is about a broken code that created a shared
                        reality and gave the heroic systems meaning.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Shrinkage of Moral Horizons</h3>
                <p>When a soldier experiences this Betrayal of What’s Right, there is a devastating and often permanent
                    effect: Dr. Shay notes that “soldiers sometimes lose responsiveness to the claims of any bonds,
                    ideals, or loyalties outside of a tiny circle of immediate comrades” (23), which often does not
                    include their own family. A healthy soldier's “social horizon” will often include his family,
                    civilian friends, and ties, as well as a wider map of his military formations, such as his whole
                    battalion, even though the soldier would only work tangentially with many of these acquaintances.
                    Due to betrayal, however, this social map of the soldier’s world will dramatically shrink.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    “Annihilation of convention [Homer’s themis] by another’s acts can destroy… stable character…it can,
                    quite simply, produce bestiality, the utter loss of human relatedness.” — <strong>Martha C.
                        Nussbaum</strong>
                </div>

                <h3>Death of a Special Comrade</h3>
                <p>It is perhaps impossible for anyone who has not experienced war to understand the bond that Achilles
                    and Patroclus, as well as any soldier who has fought and bled with another, have with each other. It
                    can be one of the deepest and most emotional human connections. As Dr. Shay notes, however, while
                    the battlefield nourishes this deep connection, it can also amputate it.</p>

                <p>Dr. Shay argues in his book that this is much closer to the Greek understanding of <em>philia</em>,
                    or “the very strongest affective relationships that human beings can form” (41). The depth of this
                    love can be a cause of further alienation because “our culture insists upon the gender association
                    of nurturance and compassion as maternal” (49), which refers to the conflict between such an
                    expression of love and the masculine-centric culture of the U.S. military.</p>

                <h3>Code of the Streets</h3>
                <p>Elijah Anderson provides us, through his illuminating work explaining inner-city gang violence
                    <em>Code of the Streets</em>, with a more contemporary method to understand the foundations of a
                    society built on honor and shame and governed by a zero-sum system.
                </p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>The Code</strong>
                    <p>“…a set of informal rules governing interpersonal and public behavior, including violence. The
                        rules prescribe both proper comportment and a proper way to respond if challenged. They regulate
                        the use of violence and so allow those who are inclined to aggression to precipitate violent
                        encounters in an approved way…”</p>
                    <p>“…At the heart of the code is the issue of respect--loosely defined as being treated "right" or
                        granted the deference one deserves.”</p>
                </div>

                <p>That last part of the code should sound similar as well; not only is it an example of what Dr. Shay
                    termed as a “Betrayal of What’s Right,” it also mirrors the pageantry of many of the warrior
                    cultures: Achilles’ armor, the creation of his new shield, Beowulf’s sword(s) and armbands, etc.</p>
