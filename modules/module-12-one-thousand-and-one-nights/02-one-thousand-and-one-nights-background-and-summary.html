                <p>To give background for <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>, we must begin, not in ancient Persia
                    where the stories originated, but in 17th and 18th-century France. The central figure in this story
                    is <strong>Antoine Galland</strong> (1646–1715), a French scholar employed by the King of France to
                    acquire antiquities and manuscripts from the Near East. Galland was also a linguist, traveler,
                    diplomat, and what was known as an <strong>Orientalist</strong>. Galland introduced Western
                    audiences to The Nights, making him one of the key figures responsible for the spread of these tales
                    in Europe.</p>
                <p>Medieval Arab authors knew about <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>, but they did not celebrate it
                    as a literary masterpiece. A 10th-century historian Al-Masudi described it as a collection of “silly
                    stories about the Kings of Old” and mentioned that the tales had originally been written in Persian,
                    Sanskrit, and Greek. He explicitly named a Persian collection called <em>Hazār Afsāna</em> (“A
                    Thousand Tales”), which was later translated into Arabic. At this point, the collection was simply
                    called <em>One Thousand Nights</em> and did not yet have the additional night. The familiar framing
                    story of <strong>Scheherazade</strong> and her sister, Dunyazad, was already present in this earlier
                    version.</p>
                <p>Galland, while working in the Middle East in the late 17th century, collected various manuscripts and
                    learned Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. In 1698, he translated the stories of <strong>Sinbad the
                        Sailor</strong> from their cycle, but mistakenly believed they were part of The Nights. No
                    manuscript of <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em> included the Sinbad tales until Galland’s French
                    translation, which later led to their inclusion in subsequent Arabic editions. Thus, when Sinbad
                    appears in modern versions of The Nights, it is due to Galland’s decision to incorporate these
                    stories.</p>
                <p>Galland eventually obtained a Syrian manuscript of The Nights dating back to the 15th century. This
                    manuscript contained only 35 tales across 271 nights, far fewer than the 1,001 nights implied by the
                    title. To meet the expectations of his audience, Galland added several stories from other sources,
                    including the Sinbad tales, as well as new stories recounted to him by a Syrian Christian informant
                    named <strong>Hanna Diab</strong>. Among these stories were <strong>Aladdin</strong> and <strong>Ali
                        Baba and the Forty Thieves</strong>—two tales that do not appear in any earlier Arabic
                    manuscript but were first included in Galland’s French version. In fact, these stories likely
                    originated with Galland, further demonstrating how his translation was less of a direct transfer
                    from Arabic texts and more of an adaptation.</p>
                <p>Galland’s translation, <em>Les Mille et Une Nuits</em>, was published between 1704 and 1717 and
                    became a sensation in Europe. His work was quickly translated into English, and most Western
                    versions of The Nights are derived from Galland’s edition. While later translations would claim to
                    be based on Arabic sources, most were simply reworkings of Galland’s text with some added materials.
                    His translation introduced Europe to The Nights, but it was far from a faithful reproduction of the
                    original Syrian manuscript.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><em>One Thousand and One Nights</em> consists of numerous tales, with the exact number varying
                    depending on how they are counted, but the collection begins with a framing story.</p>
                <p>The frame story tells of <strong>King Shahryar</strong>, who, after discovering his wife’s
                    infidelity, becomes convinced that all women are treacherous. He decides to marry a different maiden
                    every night and execute her the next morning. Shahryar’s kingdom is soon in revolt as the supply of
                    available young women dwindles. His <strong>vizier</strong>, tasked with procuring these women, has
                    two daughters: <strong>Scheherazade</strong> and Dunyazad.</p>
                <p>Scheherazade, determined to end the king’s reign of terror, volunteers to be his next bride. On their
                    wedding night, she requests that her younger sister, Dunyazad, be allowed to visit so that
                    Scheherazade can say goodbye. After the marriage, Dunyazad arrives, and Scheherazade begins to tell
                    a story. However, she leaves it unfinished by dawn, compelling the king to spare her life for
                    another day so he can hear the conclusion.</p>
                <p>This cycle continues for 1,001 nights. Every night, Scheherazade tells a tale, often embedding
                    stories within stories, a narrative structure known as <strong>mise en abyme</strong> (stories
                    within stories). For example, one night she tells the tale of The Hunchback, which leads to the tale
                    of the Tailor, and then to the tale of the Barber. The stories vary from comedies to tragedies,
                    romances to fables, all interwoven with themes of love, justice, faith, and betrayal.</p>
                <p>Over time, Scheherazade’s storytelling changes Shahryar’s heart. By the end of the 1,001 nights, he
                    falls in love with her and abandons his vengeful decree, making Scheherazade his queen. Through her
                    tales, Scheherazade not only saves her own life but also transforms Shahryar into a wise and just
                    ruler.</p>
