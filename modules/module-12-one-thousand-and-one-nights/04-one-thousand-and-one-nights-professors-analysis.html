                <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #44546a;">An Arabic
                    Manuscript of 1001 Nights</p>

                <p>One of the themes running throughout the entire <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em> is the oppressor
                    and the oppressed. This is Scheherazade’s chosen strategy and specific act of agency by employing a
                    feminine virtue. Many stories explore this theme explicitly, and it is all meant to tacitly persuade
                    Shahryar to reason. We see this tension of the oppressor and the oppressed throughout various tales:
                    “the powerful Djinn locked in bottles, kings and their servants, parents, and children” (). There
                    are many examples of women battling for survival in unjust patriarchy, and the tales that mirror
                    Scheherazade’s situation are the most poignant.</p>

                <p>We also get to see many examples of women triumphing. Previously made powerless women find ways to
                    regain some sovereignty while those who rule through hypocrisy and force are humbled. This
                    contradiction, of course, relates directly to King Shahryar; it is precisely Shahryar’s
                    irrationality towards his wife, for love, we will say, that he reacts so strongly. His love turns
                    quickly to hate; it is a purely emotional response from an otherwise good King. The fact that his
                    wife rules his emotions so profoundly points to the power she has over Shahryar. However, the love
                    between Shahryar and his first, unfaithful wife is itself a lesson in misogyny. There is blatant
                    hypocrisy in a man with multiple concubines becoming jealous of a spouse who is also unfaithful. The
                    notion that Shahryar does not simply punish his wife but an entire kingdom’s worth of daughters
                    further highlights how widespread misogyny was at the time. Shahryar and his brother, who are both
                    representatives of an entire kingdom, punish all women for the actions of two women, and the system
                    unjustly bases this conviction on a standard to which neither King would hold themselves.</p>

                <p>Scheherazade weaves these stories for Shahryar with the intent to humanize women and educate them.
                    The stories also follow the logical progression of deradicalizing Shahryar. The stories begin with
                    brutal and dark content, mirroring Shahryar’s perspective, highlighting that adultery usually
                    happens for a reason and that jealousy and violence always lead to misery. There is a story of a
                    wicked woman and another of a man acting idiotically to balance the system. In time, she introduces
                    a historical figure, Haroun al-Rashid, to act as a foil for the King. Haroun al-Rashid is known to
                    have loved art, poetry, and music, but most notably: he believed all people should be treated
                    equally.</p>

                <p>In light of Scheherazade’s core purpose for recounting her tales, the treatment of <em>One Thousand
                        and One Nights</em> by the European Imperialist colonizers is deeply ironic. Even after all the
                    apparent plagiarism by Galland in his “translation” noted earlier, a few manuscripts discovered in
                    the 1800s, which contained, for example, the orphan tales of Aladdin and Alibaba, helped solve the
                    mystery of where these extra tales originated. We now know these were just elaborate fakes,
                    amounting to retranslations into Arabic of Galland’s French version. It is as if Galland’s
                    orientalist endeavor could not be escaped.</p>

                <p>Entered the two best-known English translations of <em>The Nights</em>: Edward Lane’s, published from
                    1838 to 1841, and Richard Francis Burton’s, published from 1885 to 1887. In the interest of time, we
                    will skip over Lane’s contribution. He is an interesting fellow but not as relevant here. Lane and
                    Burton were the exact opposites; Lane was concise, while Burton was verbose if we are kind. Whereas
                    Lane labored hard to make his work family-friendly and palatable to the broadest possible audience,
                    Burton accentuated the erotic elements of <em>The Nights</em>. At the time, Burton’s work was
                    available only to a small society of discrete, many of whom one would imagine creepy, gentlemanly
                    subscribers. Burton is one of the most colorful and appalling characters in the history of the
                    Middle East studies. He was a soldier with a gift for languages who thought of himself as a scholar
                    and archaeologist. Some considered him one of the Victorian Age’s great explorers. He traveled
                    throughout the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. He is best known for two achievements:
                    being one of the co-discoverers of the source of the Nile and disguising himself as a Muslim to go
                    on a pilgrimage to Meccah. After each of his travels, he never failed to write thrilling and
                    self-aggrandizing memoirs. However, he was also a racist, misogynist, and imperialist when racists
                    and imperialists were striving to outdo one another.</p>

                <p>Moreover, he was one of the loudest voices in the English-speaking world to spread the vicious idea
                    that the Middle East was part of the exotic, erotic, and easily exploitable East in almost
                    everything he translated. The Sanskrit Kama Sutra, for example, was intended as a vehicle to expose
                    his Victorian audiences to the kinky sexual practices of other cultures and, above all, the flash
                    about his erudition. Thus, it is nearly impossible to talk about <em>One Thousand and One
                        Nights</em> without discussing the blatant and destructive Orientalist project that plagues it.
                </p>

                <p>In the Orientalist tradition, Americans and western Europeans often portrayed the East as exotic and
                    enigmatic while simultaneously judging and romanticizing it without ever understanding it. Deep
                    down, the “translators” like Galland felt their values were justified. After all, Galland was an
                    elitist. His distaste for the lifestyle of the “others” affirmed his perspective. Thus, scholars
                    like him published reports, collections, and translations portraying the East as raucous,
                    uncultured, and unintelligent because these “other” cultures deviated from their values. Said went
                    further; he thought Western scholarship held strong ties to the domineering, imperialist societies
                    that produced it, concluding that much Western scholarship about Middle Eastern and Asian cultures
                    was inherently political and intellectually dubious. Said argued that stereotyping became
                    justification for Western colonization of Middle Eastern and Asian countries. The West painted a
                    picture of an Eastern world that needed civilizing. The invasion was framed as salvation, rescuing
                    the inhabitants who were too lazy and too pleasure-focused to be fit to govern themselves. So, we
                    can deduce that either the West was blind to its failings and did not recognize its portrayal of the
                    East as stereotyping, or it believed that its own culture was superior. Edward Said’s book became
                    the foundational text for postcolonial studies and transformed Middle Eastern and Asian Studies. His
                    theory remains critically relevant today, so much so that it has become part of our language. The
                    term Orientalism describes a patronizing Western attitude towards other cultures from the Middle
                    East and Asia. So, Scheherazade has her work cut out for her; not only must she deconstruct the
                    misogyny inherent in patriarchy but also the Orientalist project that robs her of her agency yet
                    again.</p>
