                                <span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the
                                    themes running throughout the entire <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> is the
                                    oppressor and the oppressed. This is Scheherazade’s chosen strategy and specific act
                                    of agency by employing a feminine virtue. Many stories explore this theme
                                    explicitly, and it is all meant to tacitly persuade Shahryar to reason. We see this
                                    tension of the oppressor and the oppressed throughout various tales: “the powerful
                                    Djinn locked in bottles, kings and their servants, parents, and children” (). There
                                    are many examples of women battling for survival in unjust patriarchy, and the tales
                                    that mirror Scheherazade’s situation are the most poignant.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p
                                style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We also get to
                                    see many examples of women triumphing. Previously made powerless women find ways to
                                    regain some sovereignty while those who rule through hypocrisy and force are
                                    humbled. This contradiction, of course, relates directly to King Shahryar; it is
                                    precisely Shahryar’s irrationality towards his wife, for love, we will say, that he
                                    reacts so strongly. His love turns quickly to hate; it is a purely emotional
                                    response from an otherwise good King. The fact that his wife rules his emotions so
                                    profoundly points to <b>the power</b> she has over Shahryar. However, the love
                                    between Shahryar and his first, unfaithful wife is itself a lesson in misogyny.
                                    There is blatant hypocrisy in a man with multiple concubines becoming jealous of a
                                    spouse who is also unfaithful. The notion that Shahryar does not simply punish his
                                    wife but an entire kingdom’s worth of daughters further highlights how widespread
                                    misogyny was at the time. Shahryar and his brother, who are both representatives of
                                    an entire kingdom, punish all women for the actions of two women, and the system
                                    unjustly bases this conviction on a standard to which neither King would hold
                                    themselves.</span>
                            </p>

                                <span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Scheherazade
                                    weaves these stories for Shahryar with the intent to humanize women and educate
                                    them. The stories also follow the logical progression of deradicalizing Shahryar.
                                    The stories begin with brutal and dark content, mirroring Shahryar’s perspective,
                                    highlighting that adultery usually happens for a reason and that jealousy and
                                    violence always lead to misery. There is a story of a wicked woman and another of a
                                    man acting idiotically to balance the system. In time, she introduces a historical
                                    figure, Haroun al-Rashid, to act as a foil for the King. Haroun al-Rashid is known
                                    to have loved art, poetry, and music, but most notably: he believed all people
                                    should be treated equally.</span>

                                <span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In light of
                                    Scheherazade’s core purpose for recounting her tales, the treatment of <i>One
                                        Thousand and One Nights</i> by the European Imperialist colonizers is deeply
                                    ironic. Even after all the apparent plagiarism by Galland in his “translation” noted
                                    earlier, a few manuscripts discovered in the 1800s, which contained, for example,
                                    the orphan tales of <i>Aladdin and Alibaba,</i> helped solve the mystery of where
                                    these extra tales originated. We now know these were just elaborate fakes, amounting
                                    to retranslations into Arabic of Galland’s French version. It is as if Galland’s
                                    orientalist endeavor could not be escaped.</span>

                                <span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Entered the
                                    two best-known English translations of <i>The Nights</i>: Edward Lane’s, published
                                    from 1838 to 1841, and Richard Francis Burton’s, published from 1885 to 1887. In the
                                    interest of time, we will skip over Lane’s contribution. He is an interesting fellow
                                    but not as relevant here. Lane and Burton were the exact opposites; Lane was
                                    concise, while Burton was verbose if we are kind. Whereas Lane labored hard to make
                                    his work family-friendly and palatable to the broadest possible audience, Burton
                                    accentuated the erotic elements of <i>The Nights.</i> At the time, Burton’s work was
                                    available only to a small society of discrete, many of whom one would imagine
                                    creepy, gentlemanly subscribers. Burton is one of the most colorful and appalling
                                    characters in the history of the Middle East studies. He was a soldier with a gift
                                    for languages who thought of himself as a scholar and archaeologist. Some considered
                                    him one of the Victorian Age’s great explorers. He traveled throughout the Middle
                                    East, South Asia, and East Africa. He is best known for two achievements: being one
                                    of the co-discoverers of the source of the Nile and disguising himself as a Muslim
                                    to go on a pilgrimage to Meccah. After each of his travels, he never failed to write
                                    thrilling and<b> self-aggrandizing</b> memoirs. However, he was also a racist,
                                    misogynist, and imperialist when racists and imperialists were striving to outdo one
                                    another.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p
                                style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Moreover, he
                                    was one of the loudest voices in the English-speaking world <b>to spread the vicious
                                        idea that the Middle East was part of the exotic, erotic, and easily exploitable
                                        East</b> in almost everything he translated. The Sanskrit Kama Sutra, for
                                    example, was intended as a vehicle to expose his Victorian audiences to the kinky
                                    sexual practices of other cultures and, above all, the flash about his erudition.
                                    Thus, it is nearly impossible to talk about <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>
                                    without discussing the blatant and destructive Orientalist project that plagues
                                    it.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p
                                style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
                                <span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">In the
                                    Orientalist tradition, Americans and western Europeans often portrayed the East as
                                    exotic and enigmatic while simultaneously judging and romanticizing it without ever
                                    understanding it. Deep down, the “translators” like Galland felt their values were
                                    justified. After all, Galland was an elitist. His distaste for the lifestyle of the
                                    “others” affirmed his perspective. Thus, scholars like him published reports,
                                    collections, and translations portraying the East as raucous, uncultured, and
                                    unintelligent because these “other” cultures deviated from their values. Said went
                                    further; he thought Western scholarship held strong ties to the domineering,
                                    imperialist societies that produced it, concluding that much Western scholarship
                                    about Middle Eastern and Asian cultures was inherently political and intellectually
                                    dubious. Said argued that stereotyping became justification for Western colonization
                                    of Middle Eastern and Asian countries. The West painted a picture of an Eastern
                                    world that needed civilizing. The invasion was framed as salvation, rescuing the
                                    inhabitants who were too lazy and too pleasure-focused to be fit to govern
                                    themselves. So, we can deduce that either the West was blind to its failings and did
                                    not recognize its portrayal of the East as stereotyping, or it believed that its own
                                    culture was superior. Edward Said’s book became the foundational text for
                                    postcolonial studies and transformed Middle Eastern and Asian Studies. His theory
                                    remains critically relevant today, so much so that it has become part of our
                                    language. The term Orientalism describes a patronizing Western attitude towards
                                    other cultures from the Middle East and Asia. So, Scheherazade has her work cut out
                                    for her; not only must she deconstruct the misogyny inherent in patriarchy but also
                                    the Orientalist project that robs her of her agency yet again.</span>

                            <p>As noted, there is a clear double standard in Shahrayar's violent and negative response
                                to his wife's infidelity. Shahrayar was clearly not faithful with multiple official
                                concubines, yet he was still deeply jealous and violent in his reaction to his wife
                                partaking in the same behavior. Here is a primer on envy:</p>

                            <p>As noted in the video, envy can be sparked because the event, e.g., the Queen committing
                                infidelity, signals a loss in social statuses, like Briseis being taken from Achilles in
                                Chapter Two. Achilles saw Briseis <strong>as nothing more than an object</strong> that
                                signaled his standing, however, and this is not an acceptable view of women. Shahrayar
                                is also guilty of this objectification of women due to his jealousy; this is also
                                reflected in many of the stories Scheherazade orates, including the story of the demon
                                who keeps a woman in a box to control her and keep her "pure" (<em>note this has the
                                    exact opposite effect!</em>).</p>
                            <p>Similar to the aforementioned loss of honor, in our modern societal understanding (where
                                we do not fight each other to the death for honor and standing), it is common knowledge
                                that a sense of insecurity creates envy or jealousy. However, love is not jealous nor
                                possessive, as many secular and religious texts convey. Here is Chantelle Anderson, a
                                Vanderbilt basketball player speaking to the cost of insecurity:</p>

                            <p>With this in mind, what does Scheherazade teach Shahrayar and her audience (us!) about
                                the nature of love and compassion and the dangers of an insecure, jealous mind?</p>
