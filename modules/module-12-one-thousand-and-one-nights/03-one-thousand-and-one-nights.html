                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;AND AFTERWARD. Verily the works and words of those gone before us have become instances
                    and examples to men of our modern day, that folk may view what admonishing chances befell other folk
                    and may therefrom take warning; and that they may peruse the annals of antique peoples and all that
                    hath betided them, and be thereby ruled and restrained. Praise, therefore, be to Him who hath made
                    the histories of the past an admonition unto the present! Now of such instances are the tales called
                    "A Thousand Nights and a Night," together with their far-famed legends and wonders.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Therein it is related (but Allah it is All-knowing of His hidden things and All-ruling
                    and All-honored and All-giving and All-gracious and All-merciful!) that in tide of yore and in time
                    long gone before, there was a King of the Kings of the Banu Sasan in the islands of India and China,
                    a Lord of armies and guards and servants and dependents. He left only two sons, one in the prime of
                    manhood and the other yet a youth, while both were knights and braves, albeit the elder was a
                    doughtier horseman than the younger. So he succeeded to the empire, when he ruled the land and
                    lorded it is over his lieges with justice so exemplary that he was beloved by all the peoples of his
                    capital and of his kingdom. His name was King Shahryar, and he made his younger brother, Shah Zaman
                    hight, King of Samarkand in Barbarian land. These two ceased not to abide in their several realms
                    and the law was ever carried out in their dominions. And each ruled his own kingdom with equity and
                    fair dealing to his subjects, in extreme solace and enjoyment, and this condition continually
                    endured for a score of years.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the twentieth twelvemonth the elder King yearned for a sight of his
                    younger brother and felt that he must look upon him once more. So he took counsel with his Wazir
                    about visiting him, but</p>
                <p>&nbsp;the Minister, finding the project unadvisable, recommended that a letter be written and a
                    present be sent under his charge to the younger brother, with an invitation to visit the elder.
                    Having accepted this advice, the King forthwith bade prepare handsome gifts, such as horses with
                    saddles of gem-encrusted gold; Mamelukes, or white slaves; beautiful handmaids, high-breasted
                    virgins, and splendid stuffs and costly. He then wrote a letter to Shah Zaman expressing his warm
                    love and great wish to see him, ending with these words: "We therefore hope of the favor and
                    affection of the beloved brother that he will condescend to bestir himself and turn his face usward.
                    Furthermore, we have sent our Wazir to make all ordinance for the march, and our one and only desire
                    it is to see thee ere we die. But if thou delay or disappoint us, we shall not survive the blow.
                    Wherewith peace be upon thee!"</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then King Shahryar, having sealed the missive and given it is to the Wazir with the
                    offerings aforementioned, commanded him to shorten his skirts and strain his strength and make all
                    expedition in going and returning. "Harkening and obedience!" quoth the Minister, who fell to making
                    ready without stay and packed up his loads and prepared all his requisites without delay. This
                    occupied him three days, and on the dawn of the fourth he took leave of his King and marched right
                    away, over desert and hallway, stony waste and pleasant lea, without halting by night or by day. But
                    whenever he entered a realm whose ruler was subject to his suzerain, where he was greeted with
                    magnificent gifts of gold and silver and all manner of presents fair and rare, he would tarry there
                    three days, the term of the guest rite. And when he left on the fourth, he would be honorably
                    escorted for a whole day's march.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the Wazir drew near Shah Zaman's court in Samarkand he dispatched to report
                    his arrival one of his high officials, who presented himself before the King and, kissing ground
                    between his hands, delivered his message. Hereupon the King commanded sundry of his grandees and
                    lords of his realm to fare forth and meet his brother's Wazir at the distance of a full day's
                    journey. Which they did, greeting him respectfully and wishing him all prosperity and forming an
                    escort and a procession. When he entered the city, he proceeded straightway to the palace, where he
                    presented himself in the royal presence; and after kissing ground and praying for the King's health
                    and happiness and for victory over all his enemies, he informed him that his brother was yearning to
                    see him, and prayed for the pleasure of a visit.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He then delivered the letter, which Shah Zaman took from his hand and read. It contained
                    sundry hints and allusions which required thought, but when the King had fully comprehended its
                    import, he said, "I hear and I obey the commands of the beloved brother!" adding to the Wazir, "But
                    we will not march till after the third day's hospitality." He appointed for the Minister fitting
                    quarters of the palace and pitching tents for the troops, rationed them with whatever they might
                    require of meat and drink and other necessaries. On the fourth day he made ready for wayfare and got
                    together sumptuous presents befitting his elder brother's majesty, and stablished his chief Wazir
                    Viceroy of the land during his absence. Then he caused his tents and camels and mules to be brought
                    forth and encamped, with their bales and loads, attendants and guards, within sight of the city, in
                    readiness to set out next morning for his brother's capital.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the night was half-spent he bethought him that he had forgotten in his palace
                    somewhat which he should have brought with him, so he returned privily and entered his apartments,
                    where he found the Queen, his wife, asleep on his own carpet bed embracing with both arms a black
                    cook of loathsome aspect and foul with kitchen grease and grime. When he saw this the world waxed
                    black before his sight and he said: "If such case happen while I am yet within sight of the city,
                    what will be the doings of this damned whore during my long absence at my brother's court?" So he
                    drew his scimitar, and cutting the two in four pieces with a single blow, left them on the carpet
                    and returned presently to his camp without letting anyone know of what had happened. Then he gave
                    orders for immediate departure and set out at once and began his travel; but he could not help
                    thinking over his wife's treason, and he kept ever saying to himself: "How could she do this deed by
                    me? How could she work her own death?" till excessive grief seized him, his color changed to yellow,
                    his body waxed weak, and he was threatened with a dangerous malady, such a one as bringeth men to
                    die. So the Wazir shortened his stages and tarried long at the watering stations, and did his best
                    to solace the King.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when Shah Zaman drew near the capital of his brother, he dispatched vaunt-couriers
                    and messengers of glad tidings to announce his arrival, and Shahryar came forth to meet him with his
                    wazirs and emirs and lords and grandees of his realm, and saluted him and joyed with exceeding joy
                    and caused the city to be decorated in his honor. When, however, the brothers met, the elder could
                    not but see the change of complexion in the younger and questioned him of his case, whereto he
                    replied: "'Tis caused by the travails of wayfare and my case needs care, for I have suffered from
                    the change of water and air! But Allah be praised for reuniting me with a brother so dear and so
                    rare!" On this wise he dissembled and kept his secret, adding: "O King of the Time and Caliph of the
                    Tide, only toil and moil have tinged my face yellow with bile and hath made my eyes sink deep in my
                    head."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the two entered the capital in all honor, and the elder brother lodged the younger
                    in a palace overhanging the pleasure garden. And after a time, seeing his condition still unchanged,
                    he attributed it is to his separation from his country and kingdom. So he let him wend his own ways
                    and asked no questions of him till one day when he again said, "O my brother, I see thou art grown
                    weaker of body and yellower of color." "O my brother," replied Shah Zaman, "I have an internal
                    wound." Still he would not tell him what he had witnessed in his wife. Thereupon Shahryar summoned
                    doctors and surgeons and bade them treat his brother according to the rules of art, which they did
                    for a whole month. But their sherbets and potions naught availed, for he would dwell upon the deed
                    of his wife, and despondency, instead of diminishing, prevailed, and leechcraft treatment utterly
                    failed.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One day his elder brother said to him: "I am going forth to hunt and course and to take
                    my pleasure and pastime. Maybe this would lighten thy heart." Shah Zaman, however, refused, saying:
                    "O my brother, my soul yearneth for naught of this sort, and I entreat thy favor to stiffer me tarry
                    quietly in this place, being wholly taken up with my malady." So King Shah Zaman passed his night in
                    the palace, and next morning when his brother had fared forth, he removed from his room and sat him
                    down at one of the lattice windows overlooking the pleasure grounds. And there he abode thinking
                    with saddest thought over his wife's betrayal, and burning sighs issued from his tortured breast.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he continued in this case lo! a postern of the palace, which was carefully kept
                    private, swung open, and out of it is came twenty slave girls surrounding his brother's wife, who
                    was wondrous fair, a model of beauty and comeliness and symmetry and perfect loveliness, and who
                    paced with the grace of a gazelle which panteth for the cooling stream. Thereupon Shah Zaman drew
                    back from the window, but he kept the bevy in sight, espying them from a place whence he could not
                    be espied. They walked under the very lattice and advanced a little way into the garden till they
                    came to a jetting fountain a-middlemost a great basin of water. Then they stripped off their
                    clothes, and behold, ten of them were women, concubines of the King, and the other ten were white
                    slaves. Then they all paired off, each with each. But the Queen, who was left alone, presently cried
                    out in a loud voice, "Here to me, O my lord Saeed!"</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And then sprang with a drop leap from one of the trees a big slobbering blackamoor with
                    rolling eyes which showed the whites, a truly hideous sight. He walked boldly up to her and threw
                    his arms round her neck while she embraced him as warmly. Then he bussed her and winding his legs
                    round hers, as a button loop clasps a button, he threw her and enjoyed her. On like wise did the
                    other slaves with the girls till all had satisfied their passions, and they ceased not from kissing
                    and clipping, coupling and carousing, till day began to wane, when the Mamelukes rose from the
                    damsels' bosoms and the blackamoor slave dismounted from the Queen's breast. The men resumed their
                    disguises and all except the Negro, who swarmed up the tree, entered the palace and closed the
                    postern door as before.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when Shah Zaman saw this conduct of his sister-in-law, he said to himself: "By Allah,
                    my calamity is lighter than this! My brother is a greater King among the Kings than I am, yet this
                    infamy goeth on in his very palace, and his wife is in love with that filthiest of filthy slaves.
                    But this only showeth that they all do it and that there is no woman but who cuckoldeth her husband.
                    Then the curse of Allah upon one and all, and upon the fools who lean against them for support or
                    who place the reins of conduct in their hands!" So he put away his melancholy and despondency,
                    regret and repine, and allayed his sorrow by constantly repeating those words, adding, "'Tis my
                    conviction that no man in this world is safe from their malice!"</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When suppertime came, they brought him the trays and he ate with voracious appetite, for
                    he had long refrained from meat, feeling unable to touch any dish, however dainty. Then he returned
                    grateful thanks to Almighty Allah, praising Him and blessing Him, and he spent a most restful night,
                    it having been long since he had savored the sweet food of sleep. Next day he broke his fast
                    heartily and began to recover health and strength, and presently regained excellent condition. His
                    brother came back from the chase ten days after, when he rode out to meet him and they saluted each
                    other. And when King Shahryar looked at King Shah Zaman, he saw how the hue of health had returned
                    to him, how his face had waxed ruddy, and how he ate with an appetite after his late scanty diet. He
                    wondered much and said: "O my brother, I was no anxious that thou wouldst join me in hunting and
                    chasing, and wouldst take thy pleasure and pastime in my dominion!" He thanked him and excused
                    himself.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the two took horse and rode into the city, and when they were seated at their ease
                    in the palace, the food trays were set before them and they ate their sufficiency. After the meats
                    were removed and they had washed their hands, King Shahryar turned to his brother and said: "My mind
                    is overcome with wonderment at thy condition. I was desirous to carry thee with me to the chase, but
                    I saw thee changed in hue, pale and wan to view, and in sore trouble of mind too. But now,
                    Alhamdolillah- glory be to God!- I see thy natural color hath returned to thy face and that thou art
                    again in the best of case. It was my belief that thy sickness came of severance from thy family and
                    friends, and absence from capital and country, so I refrained from troubling thee with further
                    questions. But now I beseech thee to expound to me the cause of thy complaint and thy change of
                    color, and to explain the reason of thy recovery and the return to the ruddy hue of health which I
                    am wont to view. So speak out and hide naught!"</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Shah Zaman heard this, he bowed groundward awhile his head, then raised it and said:
                    "I will tell thee what caused my complaint and my loss of color. But excuse my acquainting thee with
                    the cause of its return to me and the reason of my complete recovery. Indeed I pray thee not to
                    press me for a reply." Said Shahryar, who was much surprised by these words, "Let me hear first what
                    produced thy pallor and thy poor condition." "Know, then, O my brother," rejoined Shah Zaman, "that
                    when thou sentest thy Wazir with the invitation to place myself between thy hands, I made ready and
                    marched out of my city. But presently I minded me having left behind me in the palace a string of
                    jewels intended as a gift to thee. I returned for it alone, and found my wife on my carpet bed and
                    in the arms of a hideous black cook. So I slew the twain and came to thee, yet my thoughts brooded
                    over this business and I lost my bloom and became weak. But excuse me if I still refuse to tell thee
                    what was the reason of my complexion returning."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shahryar shook his head, marveling with extreme marvel, and with the fire of wrath
                    flaming up from his heart, he cried, "Indeed, the malice of woman is mighty!" Then he took refuge
                    from them with Allah and said: "In very sooth, O my brother, thou hast escaped many an evil by
                    putting thy wife to death, and right excusable were thy wrath and grief for such mishap, which never
                    yet befell crowned king like thee. By Allah, had the case been mine, I would not have been satisfied
                    without slaying a thousand women, and that way madness lies! But now praise be to Allah Who hath
                    tempered to thee thy tribulation, and needs must thou acquaint me with that which so suddenly
                    restored to thee complexion and health, and explain to me what causeth this concealment." "O King of
                    the Age, again I pray thee excuse my so doing!" "Nay, but thou must." "I fear, O my brother, lest
                    the recital cause thee more anger and sorrow than afflicted me." "That were but a better reason,"
                    quoth Shahryar, "for telling me the whole history, and I conjure thee by Allah not to keep back
                    aught from me."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Shah Zaman told him all he had seen, from commencement to conclusion, ending
                    with these words: "When I beheld thy calamity and the treason of thy wife, O my brother, and I
                    reflected that thou art in years my senior and in sovereignty my superior, mine own sorrow was
                    belittled by the comparison, and my mind recovered tone and temper. So, throwing off melancholy and
                    despondency, I was able to eat and drink and sleep, and thus I speedily regained health and
                    strength. Such is the truth and the whole truth." When King Shahryar heard this he waxed wroth with
                    exceeding wrath, and rage was like to strangle him. But presently he recovered himself and said, "O
                    my brother, I would not give thee the lie in this matter, but I cannot credit it till I see it with
                    mine own eyes." "And thou wouldst look upon thy calamity," quoth Shah Zaman, "rise at once and make
                    ready again for hunting and coursing, and then hide thyself with me. So shalt thou witness it and
                    thine eyes shall verify it." "True," quoth the King. Whereupon he let make proclamation of his
                    intent to travel, and the troops and tents fared forth without the city, camping within sight, and
                    Shahryar sallied out with them and took seat a-midmost his host, bidding the slaves admit no man to
                    him. When night came on, he summoned his Wazir and said to him, "Sit thou in my stead, and let none
                    wot of my absence till the term of three days."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the brothers disguised themselves and returned by night with all secrecy to the
                    palace, where they passed the dark hours. And at dawn they seated themselves at the lattice
                    overlooking the pleasure grounds, when presently the Queen and her handmaids came out as before, and
                    passing under the windows, made for the fountain. Here they stripped, ten of them being men to ten
                    women, and the King's wife cried out, "Where art thou, O Saeed?" The hideous blackamoor dropped from
                    the tree straightway, and rushing into her arms without stay or delay, cried out, "I am Sa'ad al-Din
                    Saood!" The lady laughed heartily, and all fell to satisfying their lusts, and remained so occupied
                    for a couple of hours, when the white slaves rose up from the handmaidens' breasts and the
                    blackamoor dismounted from the Queen's bosom. Then they went into the basin and after performing the
                    ghusl, or complete ablution, donned their dresses and retired as they had done before.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When King Shahryar saw this infamy of his wife and concubines, he became as one
                    distraught, and he cried out: "Only in utter solitude can man be safe from the doings of this vile
                    world! By Allah, life is naught but one great wrong." Presently he added, "Do not thwart me, O my
                    brother, in what I propose." And the other answered, "I will not." So he said: "Let us up as we are
                    and depart forthright hence, for we have no concern with kingship, and let us overwander Allah's
                    earth, worshiping the Almighty till we find someone to whom the like calamity hath happened. And if
                    we find none then will death be more welcome to us than life."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So the two brothers issued from a second private postern of the palace, and they never
                    stinted wayfaring by day and by night until they reached a tree a-middle of a meadow hard by a
                    spring of sweet water on the shore of the salt sea. Both drank of it and sat down to take their
                    rest. And when an hour of the day had gone by, lo! they heard a mighty roar and uproar in the middle
                    of the main as though the heavens were falling upon the earth, and the sea brake with waves before
                    them and from it towered a black pillar, which grew and grew till it rose skyward and began making
                    for that meadow. Seeing it, they waxed fearful exceedingly and climbed to the top of the tree, which
                    was a lofty, whence they gazed to see what might be the matter. And behold, it was a Jinni, huge of
                    height and burly of breast and bulk, broad of brow and black of blee, bearing on his head a coffer
                    of crystal. He strode to land, wading through the deep, and coming to the tree whereupon were the
                    two Kings, seated himself beneath it. He then set down the coffer on its bottom and out of it drew a
                    casket with seven padlocks of steel, which he unlocked with seven keys of steel he took from beside
                    his thigh, and out of it a young lady to come was seen, whiteskinned and of winsomest mien, of
                    stature fine and thin, and bright as though a moon of the fourteenth night she had been, or the sun
                    raining lively sheen. Even so the poet Utayyah hath excellently said:-</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rose like the morn as she shone through the night
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she gilded the grove with her gracious sight.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her radiance the sun taketh increase when
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unveileth and shameth the moonshine bright.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow down all beings between her hands
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she showeth charms with her veil undight.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she floodeth cities with torrent tears
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she flasheth her look of levin light.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jinni seated her under the tree by his side and looking at her, said: "O choicest
                    love of this heart of mine! O dame of noblest line, whom I snatched away on thy bride night that
                    none might prevent me taking thy maidenhead or tumble thee before I did, and whom none save myself
                    hath loved or hath enjoyed. O my sweetheart! I would lief sleep a little while." He then laid his
                    head upon the lady's thighs, and, stretching out hip legs, which extended down to the sea, slept and
                    snored and snarked like the roll of thunder. Presently she raised her head toward the treetop and
                    saw the two Kings perched near the summit. Then she softly lifted off her lap the Jinni's pate,
                    which she was tired of supporting, and placed it upon the ground, then, standing upright under the
                    tree, signed to the Kings, "Come ye down, ye two, and fear naught from this Ifrit." They were in a
                    terrible fright when they found that she had seen them, and answered her in the same manner, "Allah
                    upon thee and by thy modesty, O lady, excuse us from coming down!" But she rejoined by saying:
                    "Allah upon you both that ye come down forthright. And if ye come not, I will rouse upon you my
                    husband, this Ifrit, and he shall do you to die by the illest of deaths." And she continued making
                    signals to them.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, being afraid, they came down to her, and she rose before them and said, "Stroke me a
                    strong stroke, without stay or delay, otherwise will I arouse and set upon you this Ifrit, who shall
                    slay you straightway." They said to her: "O our lady, we conjure thee by Allah, let us off this
                    work, for we are fugitives from such, and in extreme dread and terror of this thy husband. How then
                    can we do it in such a way as thou desirest?" "Leave this talk. It needs must be so," quoth she, and
                    she swore them by Him who raised the skies on high without prop or pillar that if they worked not
                    her will, she would cause them to be slain and cast into the sea. Whereupon out of fear King
                    Shahryar said to King Shah Zaman, "O my brother, do thou what she biddeth thee do." But he replied,
                    "I will not do it till thou do it before I do." And they began disputing about futtering her.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then quoth she to the twain: "How is it I see you disputing and demurring? If ye do not
                    come forward like men and do the deed of kind, ye two, I will arouse upon you the Ifrit." At this,
                    by reason of their sore dread of the Jinni, both did by her what she bade them do, and when they had
                    dismounted from her, she said, "Well done!" She then took from her pocket a purse and drew out a
                    knotted string whereon were strung five hundred and seventy seal rings, and asked, "Know ye what be
                    these?" They answered her saying, "We know not!" Then quoth she: "These be the signets of five
                    hundred and seventy men who have all futtered me upon the horns of this foul, this foolish, this
                    filthy Ifrit. So give me also your two seal rings, ye pair of brothers."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When they had drawn their two rings from their hands and given them to her, she said to
                    them: "Of a truth this Ifrit bore me off on my bride night, and put me into a casket and set the
                    casket in a coffer, and to the coffer he affixed seven strong padlocks of steel and deposited me on
                    the deep bottom of the sea that raves, dashing and clashing with waves, and guarded me so that I
                    might remain chaste and honest, quotha! that none save himself might have connection with me. But I
                    have lain under as many of my kind as I please, and this wretched Jinni wotteth not that Destiny may
                    not be averted nor hindered by aught, and that whatso woman willeth, the same she fulfilleth however
                    man nilleth. Even so saith one of them:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rely not on women,
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust not to their hearts,
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose joys and whose sorrows
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are hung to their parts!
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying love they will swear
                    thee <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence guile ne'er
                    departs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Yusuf for
                    sample, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ware sleights and
                    'ware smarts! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iblis ousted
                    Adam <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(See ye not?) thro' their
                    arts."
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing these words, they marveled with exceeding marvel, and she went from them to the
                    Ifrit, and taking up his head on her thigh as before, said to them softly, "Now wend your ways and
                    bear yourselves beyond the bounds of his malice." So they fared forth saying either to other,
                    "Allah! Allah!" and: "There be no Majesty and there be no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
                    Great, and with Him we seek refuge from women's malice and sleight, for of a truth it hath no mate
                    in might. Consider, O my brother, the ways of this marvelous lady with an Ifrit, who is so much more
                    powerful than we are. Now since there hath happened to him a greater mishap than that which befell
                    us and which should bear us abundant consolation, so return we to our countries and capitals, and
                    let us decide never to intermarry with womankind, and presently we will show them what will be our
                    action."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon they rode back to the tents of King Shahryar, which they reached on the morning
                    of the third day. And having mustered the wazirs and emirs, the chamberlains and high officials, he
                    gave a robe of honor to his Viceroy and issued orders for an immediate return to the city. There he
                    sat him upon his throne and, sending for the Chief Minister, the father of the two damsels who
                    (Inshallah!) will presently be mentioned, he said, "I command thee to take my wife and smite her to
                    death, for she hath broken her plight and her faith." So he carried her to the place of execution
                    and did her die. Then King Shahryar took brand in hand and, repairing to the seraglio, slew all the
                    concubines and their Mamelukes. He also sware himself by a binding oath that whatever wife he
                    married he would abate her maidenhead at night and slay her next morning, to make sure of his honor.
                    "For," said he, "there never was nor is there one chaste woman upon the face of earth."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Shah Zaman prayed for permission to fare homeward, and he went forth equipped and
                    escorted and traveled till he reached his own country. Meanwhile Shahryar commanded his Wazir to
                    bring him the bride of the night that he might go in to her. So he produced a most beautiful girl,
                    the daughter of one of the emirs, and the King went in unto her at eventide. And when morning
                    dawned, he bade his Minister strike off her head, and the Wazir did accordingly, for fear of the
                    Sultan. On this wise he continued for the space of three years, marrying a maiden every night and
                    killing her the next morning, till folk raised an outcry against him and cursed him, praying Allah
                    utterly to destroy him and his rule. And women made an uproar and mothers wept and parents fled with
                    their daughters till there remained not in the city a young person fit for carnal copulation.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently the King ordered his Chief Wazir, the same who was charged with the executions,
                    to bring him a virgin, as was his wont, and the Minister went forth and searched and found none. So
                    he returned home in sorrow and anxiety, fearing for his life from the King. Now he had two
                    daughters, Scheherazade and Dunyazade, hight, of whom the elder had perused the books, annals, and
                    legends of preceding kings, and the stories, examples, and instances of bygone men and things.
                    Indeed it was said that she had collected a thousand books of histories relating to antique races
                    and departed rulers. She had purused the works of the poets and knew them by heart, she had studied
                    philosophy and the sciences, arts, and accomplishments. And she was pleasant and polite, wise and
                    witty, well read and well bred. Now on that day she said to her father: "Why do I see thee thus
                    changed and laden with cark and care? Concerning this matter quoth one of the poets:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell whoso hath sorrow
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief never shall last.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en as joy hath no morrow
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So woe shall go past."
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wazir heard from his daughter these words, he related to her, from first to
                    last, all that had happened between him and the King. Thereupon said she: "By Allah, O my father,
                    how long shall this slaughter of women endure? Shall I tell thee what is in my mind in order to save
                    both sides from destruction?" "Say on, O my daughter," quoth he, and quoth she: "I wish thou wouldst
                    give me in marriage to this King Shahryar. Either I shall live or I shall be a ransom for the virgin
                    daughters of Moslems and the cause of their deliverance from his hands and thine." "Allah upon
                    thee!" cried he in wrath exceeding that lacked no feeding. "O scanty of wit, expose not thy life to
                    such peril! How durst thou address me in words so wide from wisdom and unfar from foolishness? Know
                    that one who lacketh experience in worldly matters readily falleth into misfortune, and whoso
                    considereth not the end keepeth not the world to friend, and the vulgar say: 'I was lying at mine
                    ease. Naught but my officiousness brought me unease'." "Needs must thou," she broke in, "make me a
                    doer of this good deed, and let him kill me an he will. I shall only die a ransom for others." "O my
                    daughter," asked he, "and how shall that profit thee when thou shalt have thrown away thy life?" And
                    she answered, "O my father, it must be, come of it what will!" The Wazir was again moved to fury and
                    blamed and reproached her, ending with, "In very deed I fear lest the same befall thee which befell
                    the bull and the ass with the husbandman." "And what," asked she, "befell them, O my father?"

                        <h1>THE TALE OF THE BULL AND THE ASS</h1>
                    </center>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;KNOW, O my daughter, that there was once a merchant who
                        owned much money and many men, and who was rich in cattle and camels. He had also a wife and
                        family, and he dwelt in the country, being experienced in husbandry and devoted to agriculture.
                        Now Allah Most High had endowed him with understanding the tongues of beasts and birds of every
                        kind, but under pain of death if he divulged the gift to any. So he kept it secret for very
                        fear. He had in his cow house a bull and an ass, each tethered in his own stall, one hard by the
                        other. As the merchant was sitting near-hand one day with his servans and his children were
                        playing about him, he heard and bull say to the ass:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hail and health to thee O Father of Waking! for that thou
                        enjoyest rest and good ministering. All under thee is clean-swept and fresh-sprinkled. Men wait
                        upon thee and feed thee, and thy provaunt is sifted barley and thy drink pure spring water,
                        while I (unhappy creature!) am led forth in the middle of the night, when they set on my neck
                        the plow and a something called yoke, and I tire at cleaving the earth from dawn of day till set
                        of sun. I am forced to do more than I can and to bear all manner of ill-treatment from night to
                        night. After which they take me back with my sides torn, my neck flayed, my legs aching, and
                        mine eyelids sored with tears. Then they shut me up in the byre and throw me beans and crushed
                        straw mixed with dirt and chaff, and I lie in dung and filth and foul stinks through the
                        livelong night. But thou art ever in a place swept and sprinkled and cleansed, and thou art
                        always lying at ease, save when it happens (and seldom enough!) that the master hath some
                        business, when he mounts thee and rides thee to town and returns with thee forthright. So it
                        happens that I am toiling and distrest while thou takest thine ease and thy rest. Thou sleepest
                        while I am sleepless, I hunger still while thou eatest thy fill, and I win contempt while thou
                        winnest goodwill."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bull ceased speaking, the ass turned toward him
                        and said: "O Broad-o'-Brow, O thou lost one! He lied not who dubbed thee bullhead, for thou, O
                        father of a bull, hast neither forethought nor contrivance. Thou art the simplest of simpletons,
                        and thou knowest naught of good advisers. Hast thou not heard the saying of the wise?</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For others these hardships and labors I
                        bear,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And theirs is the pleasure and mine is the
                        care,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bleacher who blacketh his brow in the
                        sun<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whiten the raiment which other men wear.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">But thou, O fool, art full of zeal, and thou toilest and moilest before
                        the master, and thou tearest and wearest and slayest thyself for the comfort of another. Hast
                        thou never heard the saw that saith 'None to guide and from the way go wide'? Thou wendest forth
                        at the call to dawn prayer and thou returnest not till sundown, and through the livelong day
                        thou endurest all manner hardships: to wit, beating and belaboring and bad language.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now hearken to me, Sir Bull! When they tie thee to thy
                        stinking manger, thou pawest the ground with thy forehand and lashest out with thy hind hoofs
                        and pushest with thy horns and bellowest aloud, so they deem thee contented. And when they throw
                        thee thy fodder, thou fallest on it with greed and hastenest to line thy fair fat paunch. But if
                        thou accept any advice, it will be better for thee, and thou wilt lead an easier life even than
                        mine. When thou goest afield and they lay the thing called yoke on thy neck, be down and rise
                        not again, though haply they swings thee. And if thou rise, lie down a second time. And when
                        they bring thee home and offer thee thy beans, fall backward and only sniff at thy meat and
                        withdraw thee and taste it not, and be satisfied with thy crushed straw and chaff. And on this
                        wise feign thou art sick, and cease not doing thus for a day or two days or even three days; so
                        shalt thou have rest from toil and moil."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bull heard these words, he knew the ass to be his
                        friend and thanked him, saying, "Right is thy rede," and prayed that all blessings might requite
                        him, and cried: "O Father Wakener! Thou hast made up for my failings." (Now the merchant, O my
                        daughter, understood all that passed between them.) Next day the driver took the bull and,
                        settling the plow on his neck, made him work as wont. But the bull began to shirk his plowing,
                        according to the advice of the ass, and the plowman drubbed him till he broke the yoke and made
                        off. But the man caught him up and leathered him till he despaired of his life. Not the less,
                        however, would he do nothing but stand still and drop down till the evening. Then the herd led
                        him home and stabled him in his stall, but he drew back from his manger and neither stamped nor
                        ramped nor butted nor bellowed as he was wont to do, whereat the man wondered. He brought him
                        the beans and husks, but he sniffed at them and left them and lay down as far from them as he
                        could and passed the whole night fasting. The peasant came next morning and, seeing the manger
                        full of beans, the crushed straw untasted, and the ox lying on his back in sorriest plight, with
                        legs outstretched and swollen belly, he was concerned for him, and said to himself, "By Allah,
                        he hath assuredly sickened, and this is the cause why he would not plow yesterday."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went to the merchant and reported: "O my master,
                        the bull is ailing. He refused his fodder last night- nay, more, he hath not tasted a scrap of
                        it this morning." Now the merchant-farmer understood what all this meant, because he had
                        overheard the talk between the bull and the ass, so quoth he, "Take that rascal donkey, and set
                        the yoke on his neck, and bind him to the plow and make him do bull's work." Thereupon the
                        plowman took the ass, and worked him through the livelong day at the bull's task. And when be
                        failed for weakness, he made him eat stick till his ribs were sore and his sides were sunken and
                        his neck was rayed by the yoke. And when he came home in the evening he could hardly drag his
                        limbs along, either forehand or hind legs. But as for the bull, he had passed the day lying at
                        full length, and had eaten his fodder with an excellent appetite, and he ceased not calling down
                        blessings on the ass for his good advice, unknowing what had come to him on his account.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;So when night set in and the ass returned to the byre, the
                        bull rose up before him in honor, and said: "May good tidings gladden thy heart, O Father
                        Wakener! Through thee I have rested all this day, and I have eaten my meat in peace and quiet."
                        But the ass returned no reply, for wrath and heartburning and fatigue and the beating he had
                        gotten. And he repented with the most grievous of repentance, and quoth he to himself: "This
                        cometh of my folly in giving good counsel. As the saw saith, I was in joy and gladness, naught
                        save my officiousness brought me this sadness. And now I must take thought and put a trick upon
                        him and return him to his place, else I die." Then he went aweary to his manger while the bull
                        thanked him and blessed him.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;And even so, O my daughter (said the Wazir) thou wilt die
                        for lack of wits. Therefore sit thee still and say naught and expose not thy life to such
                        stress, for, by Allah, I offer thee the best advice, which cometh of my affection and kindly
                        solicitude for thee. "O my father," she answered, "needs must I go up to this King and be
                        married to him." Quoth he, "Do not this deed," and quoth she, "Of a truth I will." Whereat he
                        rejoined, "If thou be not silent and bide still, I will do with thee even what the merchant did
                        with his wife." "And what did be?" asked she.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Know then (answered the Wazir) that after the return of the
                        ass the merchant came out on the terrace roof with his wife and family, for it was a moonlit
                        night and the moon at its full. Now the terrace overlooked the cow house, and presently as he
                        sat there with his children playing about him, the trader heard the ass say to the bull, "Tell
                        me, O Father Broad-o'-Brow, what thou purposest to do tomorrow." The bull answered: "What but
                        continue to follow thy counsel, O Aliboron? Indeed it was as good as good could be, and it hath
                        given me rest and repose, nor will I now depart from it one tittle. So when they bring me my
                        meat, I will refuse it and blow out my belly and counterfeit crank." The ass shook his head and
                        said, "Beware of so doing, O Father of a Bull!" The buff asked, "Why?" and the ass answered,
                        "Know that I am about to give thee the best of counsel, for verily I heard our owner say to the
                        herd, 'If the bull rise not from his place to do his work this morning and if he retire from his
                        fodder this day, make him over to the butcher that he may slaughter him and give his flesh to
                        the poor, and fashion a bit of leather from his hide.' Now I fear for thee on account of this.
                        So take my advice ere a calamity befall thee, and when they bring thee thy fodder, eat it and
                        rise up and bellow and paw the ground, or our master will assuredly slay thee. And peace be with
                        thee!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the bull arose and lowed aloud and thanked the
                        ass, and said, "Tomorrow I will readily go forth with them." And he at once ate up all his meat
                        and even licked the manger. (All this took place and the owner was listening to their talk.)
                        Next morning the trader and his wife went to the bull's crib and sat down, and the driver came
                        and led forth the bull, who, seeing his owner, whisked his tail and brake wind, and frisked
                        about so lustily that the merchant laughed a loud laugh and kept laughing till he fell on his
                        back. His wife asked him, "Whereat laughest thou with such loud laughter as this?" and he
                        answered her, "I laughed at a secret something which I have heard and seen but cannot say lest I
                        die my death." She returned, "Perforce thou must discover it to me, and disclose the cause of
                        thy laughing even if thou come by thy death!" But he rejoined, "I cannot reveal what beasts and
                        birds say in their lingo for fear I die." Then quoth she: "By Allah, thou liest! This is a mere
                        pretext. Thou laughest at none save me, and now thou wouldest hide somewhat from me. But by the
                        Lord of the Heaven, an thou disclose not the cause I will no longer cohabit with thee, I will
                        leave thee at once." And she sat down and cried.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereupon quoth the merchant: "Woe betide thee! What means
                        thy weeping? Fear Allah, and leave these words and query me no more questions." "Needs must thou
                        tell me the cause of that laugh," said she, and he replied: "Thou wettest that when I prayed
                        Allah to vouchsafe me understanding of the tongues of beasts and birds, I made a vow never to
                        disclose the secret to any under pain of dying on the spot." "No matter!" cried she. "Tell me
                        what secret passed between the bull and the ass and die this very hour an thou be so minded."
                        And she ceased not to importune him till he was worn-out and clean distraught. So at last he
                        said, "Summon thy father and thy mother and our kith and kin and sundry of our neighbors." Which
                        she did, and he sent for the kazi and his assessors, intending to make his will and reveal to
                        her his secret and die the death; for he loved her with love exceeding because she was his
                        cousin, the daughter of his father's brother, and the mother of his children, and he had lived
                        with her a life of a hundred and twenty years.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, having assembled all the family and the folk of his
                        neighborhood, he said to them, "By me there hangeth a strange story, and 'tis such that if I
                        discover the secret to any, I am a dead man." Therefore quoth every one of those present to the
                        woman, "Allah upon thee, leave this sinful obstinacy and recognize the right of this matter,
                        lest haply thy husband and the father of thy children die." But she rejoined, "I will not turn
                        from it till he tell me, even though he come by his death." So they ceased to urge her, and the
                        trader rose from amongst them and repaired to an outhouse to perform the wuzu ablution, and he
                        purposed thereafter to return and to tell them his secret and to die.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Daughter Scheherazade, that merchant had in his
                        outhouses some fifty hens under one cock, and whilst making ready to farewell his folk he heard
                        one of his many farm dogs thus address in his own tongue the cock, who was flapping his wings
                        and crowing lustily and jumping from one hen's back to another and treading all in turn, saying:
                        "O Chanticleer! How mean is thy wit and how shameless is thy conduct! Be he disappointed who
                        brought thee up. Art thou not ashamed of thy doings on such a day as this?" "And what," asked
                        the rooster, "hath occurred this day?" when the dog answered; "Dost thou not know that our
                        master is this day making ready for his death? His wife is resolved that he shall disclose the
                        secret taught to him by Allah, and the moment he so doeth he shall surely die. We dogs are all
                        a-mourning, but thou clappest thy wings and clarionest thy loudest and treadest hen after hen.
                        Is this an hour for pastime and pleasuring? Art thou not ashamed of thyself?"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then by Allah," quoth the cock, "is our master a lackwit
                        and a man scanty of sense. If he cannot manage matters with a single wife, his life is not worth
                        prolonging. Now I have some fifty dame partlets, and I please this and provoke that and starve
                        one and stuff another, and through my good governance they are all well under my control. This
                        our master pretendeth to wit and wisdom, and she hath but one wife and yet knoweth not how to
                        manage her." Asked the dog, "What then, O Cock, should the master do to will clear of his
                        strait?" "He should arise forthright," answered the cock, "and take some twigs from yon mulberry
                        tree and give her a regular back-basting and ribroasting till she cry: 'I repent, O my lord! I
                        will never ask thee a question as Ion, as I live!' Then let him beat her once more and soundly,
                        and when he shall have done this, he shall sleep free from care and enjoy life. But this master
                        of ours owns neither sense nor judgment."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, Daughter Scheherazade," continued the Wazir, "I will
                        do to thee as did that husband to that wife." Said Scheherazade, "And what did he do?" He
                        replied, "When the merchant heard the wise words spoken by his cock to his dog, he arose in
                        haste and sought his wife's chamber, after cutting for her some mulberry twigs and hiding them
                        there. And then he called to her, "Come into the closet, that I may tell thee the secret while
                        no one seeth me, and then die." She entered with him and he locked the door and came down upon
                        her with so sound a beating of back and shoulders, ribs, arms, and legs, saying the while "Wilt
                        thou ever be asking questions about what concerneth thee not?" that she was well-nigh senseless.
                        Presently she cried out: "I am of the repentant! By Allah, I will ask thee no more questions,
                        and indeed I repent sincerely and wholesomely." Then she kissed his hand and feet and he led her
                        out of the room submissive, as a wife should be. Her parents and all the company rejoiced and
                        sadness and mourning were changed into joy and gladness.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the merchant learnt family discipline from his cock
                        and he and his wife lived together the happiest of lives until death. And thou also, O my
                        daughter! continued the Wazir, unless thou turn from this matter I will do by thee what that
                        trader did to his wife. But she answered him with much decision: "I will never desist, O my
                        father, nor shall this tale change my purpose. Leave such talk and tattle. I will not listen to
                        thy words and if thou deny me, I will marry myself to him despite the nose of thee. And first I
                        will go up to the King myself and alone and I will say to him: 'I prayed my father to wive me
                        with thee, but he refused, being resolved to disappoint his lord, grudging the like of me to the
                        like of thee'." Her father asked, "Must this needs be?" and she answered, "Even so."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereupon the Wazir, being weary of lamenting and
                        contending, persuading and dissuading her, all to no purpose, went up to King Shahryar and,
                        after blessing him and kissing the ground before him, told him all about his dispute with his
                        daughter from first to last and how he designed to bring her to him that night. The King
                        wondered with exceeding wonder, for he had made an especial exception of the Wazir's daughter,
                        and said to him: "O most faithful of counsellors, how is this? Thou wettest that I have sworn by
                        the Raiser of the Heavens that after I have gone into her this night I shall say to thee on the
                        morrow's 'Take her and slay her!' And if thou slay her not, I will slay thee in her stead
                        without fail." "Allah guide thee to glory and lengthen thy life, O King of the Age," answered
                        the Wazir. "It is she that hath so determined. All this have I told her and more, but she will
                        not hearken to me and she persisteth in passing this coming night with the King's Majesty." So
                        Shahryar rejoiced greatly and said, "'Tis well. Go get her ready, and this night bring her to
                        me." The Wazir returned to his daughter and reported to her the command, saying, "Allah make not
                        thy father desolate by thy loss!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;But Scheherazade rejoiced with exceeding joy and get ready
                        all she required and said to her younger sister, Dunyazade: "Note well what directions I entrust
                        to thee! When I have gone into the King I will send for thee, and when thou comest to me and
                        seest that he hath had his carnal will of me, do thou say to me: 'O my sister, an thou be not
                        sleepy, relate to me some new story, delectable and delightsome, the better to speed our waking
                        hours.' And I will tell thee a tale which shall be our deliverance, if so Allah please, and
                        which shall turn the King from his bloodthirsty custom." Dunyazade answered "With love and
                        gladness."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;So when it was night, their father the Wazir carried
                        Scheherazade to the King, who was gladdened at the sight and asked, "Hast thou brought me my
                        need?" And he answered, "I have." But when the King took her to his bed and fell to toying with
                        her and wished to go in to her, she wept, which made him ask, "What aileth thee?" She replied,
                        "O King of the Age, I have a younger sister, and lief would I take leave of her this night
                        before I see the dawn." So he sent at once for Dunyazade and she came and kissed the ground
                        between his hands, when he permitted her to take her seat near the foot of the couch. Then the
                        King arose and did away with his bride's maidenhead and the three fell asleep.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it was midnight Scheherazade awoke and signaled to
                        her sister Dunyazade, who sat up and said, "Allah upon thee, O my sister, recite to us some new
                        story, delightsome and delectable, wherewith to while away the waking hours of our latter
                        night." "With joy and goodly gree," answered Scheherazade, "if this pious and auspicious King
                        permit me." "Tell on," quoth the King, who chanced to be sleepless and restless and therefore
                        was pleased with the prospect of hearing her story. So Scheherazade rejoiced, and thus, on the
                        first night of the Thousand Nights and a Night, she began her recitations.</p>
                    <center>
                        <h1>THE FISHERMAN AND THE JINNI</h1>
                    </center>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;IT hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was a
                        fisherman well stricken in years who had a wife and three children, and withal was of poor
                        condition. Now it was his custom to cast his net every day four times, and no more. On a day he
                        went forth about noontide to the seashore, where he laid down his basket and, tucking up his
                        shirt and plunging into the water, made a cast with his net and waited till it settled to the
                        bottom. Then he gathered the cords together and haled away at it, but found it weighty. And
                        however much he drew it landward, he could not pull it up, so he carried the ends ashore and
                        drove a stake into the ground and made the net fast to it. Then he stripped and dived into the
                        water all about the net, and left not off working hard until he had brought it up.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;He rejoiced thereat and, donning his clothes, went to the
                        net, when he found in it a dead jackass which had torn the meshes. Now when he saw it, he
                        exclaimed in his grief, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious,
                        the Great!" Then quoth he, "This is a strange manner of daily bread," and he began reciting in
                        extempore verse:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O toiler through the glooms of night in peril and in
                        pain,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy toiling stint for daily bread comes not by might and
                        main!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seest thou not the fisher seek afloat upon the
                        sea<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bread, while glimmer stars of night as set in tangled
                        skein?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon he plungeth in despite the buffet of the
                        waves,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while to sight the bellying net his eager glances
                        strain,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till joying at the night's success, a fish he bringeth
                        home<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose gullet by the hook of Fate was caught and cut in
                        twain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When buys that fish of him a man who spent the hours of
                        night<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reckless of cold and wet and gloom in ease and comfort
                        fain,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laud to the Lord who gives to this, to that denies, his
                        wishes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dooms one toil and catch the prey and other eat the fishes."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Then quoth he, "Up and to it. I am sure of His beneficence, Inshallah!"
                        So he continued:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When thou art seized of Evil Fate,
                        assume<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble soul's long-suffering. 'Tis thy
                        best.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complain not to the creature, this be
                        'plaint<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From one most Ruthful to the ruthlessest."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman, when he had looked at the dead ass, got it
                        free of the toils and wrung out and spread his net. Then he plunged into the sea, saying, "In
                        Allah's name!" and made a cast and pulled at it, but it grew heavy and settled down more firmly
                        than the first time. Now he thought that there were fish in it, and he made it fast and, doffing
                        his clothes, went into the water, and dived and haled until he drew it up upon dry land. Then
                        found he in it a large earthern pitcher which was full of sand and mud, and seeing this, he was
                        greatly troubled. So he prayed pardon of Allah and, throwing away the jar, wrung his net and
                        cleansed it and returned to the sea the third time to cast his net, and waited till it had sunk.
                        Then he pulled at it and found therein potsherds and broken glass. Then, raising his eyes
                        heavenward, he said: "O my God! Verily Thou wettest that I cast not my net each day save four
                        times. The third is done and as yet Thou hast vouchsafed me nothing. So this time, O my God,
                        deign give me my daily bread."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, having called on Allah's name, he again threw his net
                        and waited its sinking and settling, whereupon he haled at it but could not draw it in for that
                        it was entangled at the bottom. He cried out in his vexation, "There is no Majesty and there is
                        no Might save in Allah!" and he began reciting:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fie on this wretched world, an so it
                        be<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must be whelmed by grief and
                        misery.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' gladsome be man's lot when dawns the
                        morn,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drains the cup of woe ere eve he
                        see.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet was I one of whom the world when
                        asked<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whose lot is happiest?' would say, ''Tis he!'"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon he stripped and, diving down to the net, busied
                        himself with it till it came to land. Then he opened the meshes and found therein a
                        cucumber-shaped jar of yellow copper, evidently full of something, whose mouth was made fast
                        with a leaden cap stamped with the seal ring of our Lord Solomon, son of David (Allah accept the
                        twain!). Seeing this, the fisherman rejoiced and said, "If I sell it in the brass bazaar, 'tis
                        worth ten golden dinars." He shook it, and finding it heavy, continued: "Would to Heaven I knew
                        what is herein. But I must and will open it and look to its contents and store it in my bag and
                        sell it in the brass market." And taking out a knife, he worked at the lead till he had loosened
                        it from the jar. Then he laid the cup on the ground and shook the vase to pour out whatever
                        might be inside. He found nothing in it, whereat he marveled with an exceeding marvel. But
                        presently there came forth from the jar a smoke which spired heavenward into ether (whereat he
                        again marveled with mighty marvel), and which trailed along earth's surface till presently,
                        having reached its full height, the thick vapor condensed, and became an Ifrit huge of bulk,
                        whose crest touched the clouds while his feet were on the ground. His head was as a dome, his
                        hands like pitchforks, his legs long as masts, and his mough big as a cave. His teeth were like
                        large stones, his nostrils ewers, his eyes two lamps, and his look was fierce and lowering.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the fisherman saw the Ifrit, his side muscles
                        quivered, his teeth chattered, his spittle dried up, and he became blind about what to do. Upon
                        this the Ifrit looked at him and cried, "there is no god but the God, and Solomon is the prophet
                        of God," presently adding: "O Apostle of Allah, slay me not. Never again will I gainsay thee in
                        word nor sin against thee in deed." Quoth the fisherman, "O Marid, diddest thou say Solomon the
                        Apostle of Allah? And Solomon is dead some thousand and eight hundred years ago, and we are now
                        in the last days of the world! What is thy story, and what is thy account of thyself, and what
                        is the cause of thy entering into this cucurbit?"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the Evil Spirit heard the words of the fisherman,
                        quoth he: "There is no god but the God. Be of good cheer, O Fisherman!" Quoth the fisherman,
                        "Why biddest thou me to be of good cheer?" And he replied, "Because of thy having to die an ill
                        death in this very hour." Said the fisherman, "Thou deservest for thy good tidings the
                        withdrawal of Heaven's protection, O thou distant one! Wherefore shouldest thou kill me, and
                        what thing have I done to deserve death, I who freed thee from the jar, and saved thee from the
                        depths of the sea, and brought thee up on the dry land?" Replied the Ifrit, "Ask of me only what
                        mode of death thou wilt die, and by what manner of slaughter shall I slay thee." Rejoined the
                        fisherman, "What is my crime, and wherefore such retribution?" Quoth the Ifrit, "Hear my story,
                        O Fisherman!" And he answered, "Say on, and be brief in thy sayinig, for of very sooth my life
                        breath is in my nostrils."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon quoth the Jinni: "Know that I am one among the
                        heretical Jann, and I sinned against Solomon, David-son (on the twain be peace!), I together
                        with the famous Sakhr al-Jinni, whereupon the Prophet sent his Minister, Asaf son of Barkhiya,
                        to seize me. And this Wazir brought me against my will and led me in bonds to him (I being
                        downcast despite my nose), and he placed me standing before him like a suppliant. When Solomon
                        saw me, he took refuge with Allah and bade me embrace the True Faith and obey his behests. But I
                        refused, so, sending for this cucurbit, he shut me up therein and stopped it over with lead,
                        whereon he impressed the Most High Name, and gave his orders to the Jann, who carried me off and
                        cast me into the midmost of the ocean. There I abode a hundred years, during which I said in my
                        heart, 'Whoso shall release me, him will I enrich forever and ever.'</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the full century went by and, when no one set me free,
                        I entered upon the second fivescore saying, 'Whoso shall release me, for him I will open the
                        hoards of the earth.' Still no one set me free, and thus four hundred years passed away. Then
                        quoth I, 'Whoso shall release me, for him will I fulfill three wishes.' Yet no one set me free.
                        Thereupon I waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and said to myself, 'Whoso shall release me from
                        this time forth, him will I slay, and I will give him choice of what death he will die.' And
                        now, as thou hast released me, I give thee full choice of deaths."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman, hearing the words of the Ifrit, said, "O
                        Allah! The wonder of it that I have not come to free thee save in these days!" adding, "Spare my
                        life, so Allah spare thine, and slay me not, lest Allah set one to slay thee." Replied the
                        Contumacious One, "There is no help for it. Die thou must, so ask by way of boon what manner of
                        death thou wilt die." Albeit thus certified, the fisherman again addressed the Ifrit, saying,
                        "Forgive me this my death as a generous reward for having freed thee," and the Ifrit, "Surely I
                        would not slay thee save on account of that same release." "O Chief of the Ifrits," said the
                        fisherman, "I do thee good and thou requitest me with evil! In very sooth the old saw lieth not
                        when it saith:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We wrought them weal, they met our weal
                        with ill,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such, by my life! is every bad man's
                        labor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him who benefits unworthy
                        wights<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall hap what hapt to Ummi-Amir's neighbor."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the Ifrit heard these words he answered: "No more
                        of this talk. Needs must I kill thee." Upon this the fisherman said to himself: "This is a
                        Jinni, and I am a man to whom Allah hath given a passably cunning wit, so I will now cast about
                        to compass his destruction by my contrivance and by mine intelligence, even as he took counsel
                        only of his malice and his frowardness." He began by asking the Ifrit, "Hast thou indeed
                        resolved to kill me?" And, receiving for all answer "Even so," he cried, "Now in the Most Great
                        Name, graven on the seal ring of Solomon the son of David (peace be with the holy twain!), an I
                        question thee on a certain matter, wilt thou give me a true answer?" The Ifrit replied "Yea,"
                        but, hearing mention of the Most Great Name, his wits were troubled and he said with trembling,
                        "Ask and be brief."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the fisherman: "How didst thou fit into this bottle
                        which would not hold thy hand- no, nor even thy foot- and how came it to be large enough to
                        contain the whole of thee?" Replied the Ifrit, "What! Dost not believe that I was all there?"
                        And the fisherman rejoined, "Nay! I will never believe it until I see thee inside with my own
                        eyes." The Evil Spirit on the instant shook and became a vapor, which condensed and entered the
                        jar little and little, till all was well inside, when lo! the fisherman in hot haste took the
                        leaden cap with the seal and stoppered therewith the mouth of the jar and called out to the
                        Ifrit, saying: "Ask me by way of boon what death thou wilt die! By Allah, I will throw thee into
                        the sea before us and here will I build me a lodge, and whoso cometh hither I will warn him
                        against fishing and will say: 'In these waters abideth an Ifrit who giveth as a last favor a
                        choice of deaths and fashion of slaughter to the man who saveth him!"'</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the Ifrit heard this from the fisherman and saw
                        himself in limbo, he was minded to escape, but this was prevented by Solomon's seal. So he knew
                        that the fisherman had cozened and outwitted him, and he waxed lowly and submissive and began
                        humbly to say, "I did but jest with thee." But the other answered, "Thou liest, O vilest of the
                        Ifrits, and meanest and filthiest!" And he set off with the bottle for the seaside, the Ifrit
                        calling out, "Nay! Nay!" and he calling out, "Aye! Aye!" Thereupon the Evil Spirit softened his
                        voice and smoothed his speech and abased himself, saying, "What wouldest thou do with me. O
                        Fisherman?" "I will throw thee back into the sea," he answered, "Where thou hast been housed and
                        homed for a thousand and eight hundred years. And now I will leave thee therein till Judgment
                        Day. Did I not say to thee, `Spare me and Allah shall spare thee, and slay me not lest Allah
                        slay thee'? yet thou spurnedst my supplication and hadst no intention save to deal ungraciously
                        by me, and Allah hath now thrown thee into my hands, and I am cunninger that thou." Quoth the
                        Ifrit, "Open for me that I may bring thee weal." Quoth the fisherman: "Thou liest, thou
                        accursed! Nothing would satisfy thee save my death, so now I will do thee die by hurling thee
                        into this sea." Then the Marid roared aloud and cried: "Allah upon thee, O Fisherman, don't!
                        Spare me, and pardon my past doings, and as I have been tyrannous, so be thou generous, for it
                        is said among sayings that go current: 'O thou who doest good to him who hath done thee evil,
                        suffice for the ill-doer his ill deeds, and do not deal with me as did Umamah to 'Atikah.'"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked the fisherman, "And what was their case?" And the
                        Ifrit answered, "This is not the time for storytelling and I in this prison, but set me free and
                        I will tell thee the tale." Quoth the fisherman: "Leave this language. There is no help but that
                        thou be thrown back into the sea, nor is there any way for thy getting out of it forever and
                        ever. Vainly I placed myself under thy protection, and I humbled myself to thee with weeping,
                        while thou soughtest only to slay me, who had done thee no injury deserving this at thy hands.
                        Nay, so far from injuring thee by any evil act, I worked thee naught but weal in releasing thee
                        from that jail of thine. Now I knew thee to be an evil-doer when thou diddest to me what thou
                        didst, and know that when I have cast thee back into this sea, I will warn whosoever may fish
                        thee up of what hath befallen me with thee, and I will advise him to toss thee back again. So
                        shalt thou abide here under these waters till The End of Time shall make an end of thee." But
                        the Ifrit cried aloud: "Set me free. This is a noble occasion for generosity, and I make
                        covenant with thee and vow never to do thee hurt and harm- nay, I will help thee to what shall
                        put thee out of want."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman accepted his promises on both conditions, not
                        to trouble him as before, but on the contrary to do him service, and after making firm the
                        plight and swearing him a solemn oath by Allah Most Highest, he opened the cucurbit. Thereupon
                        the pillar of smoke rose up till all of it was fully out, then it thickened and once more became
                        an Ifrit of hideous presence, who forthright administered a kick to the bottle and sent it
                        flying into the sea. The fisherman, seeing how the cucurbit was treated and making sure of his
                        own death, piddled in his clothes and said to himself, "This promiseth badly," but he fortified
                        his heart, and cried: "O Ifrit, Allah hath said: 'Perform your covenant, for the performance of
                        your covenant shall be inquired into hereafter.' Thou hast made a vow to me and hast sworn an
                        oath not to play me false lest Allah play thee false, for verily He is a jealous God who
                        respiteth the sinner but letteth him not escape. I say to thee as said the Sage Duban to King
                        Yunan, 'Spare me so Allah may spare thee!'" The Ifrit burst into laughter and stalked away,
                        saying to the fisherman, "Follow me."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;And the man paced after him at a safe distance (for he was
                        not assured of escape) till they had passed round the suburbs of the city. Thence they struck
                        into the uncultivated grounds and, crossing them, descended into a broad wilderness, and lo! in
                        the midst of it stood a mountain tarn. The Ifrit waded in to the middle and again cried, "Follow
                        me," and when this was done he took his stand in the center and bade the man cast his net and
                        catch his fish. The fisherman looked into the water and was much astonished to see therein
                        varicolored fishes, white and red, blue and yellow. However, he cast his net and, hauling it in,
                        saw that he had netted four fishes, one of each color. Thereat he rejoiced greatly, and more
                        when the Ifrit said to him: "Carry these to the Sultan and set them in his presence, then he
                        will give thee what shall make thee a wealthy man. And now accept my excuse, for by Allah, at
                        this time I wot none other way of benefiting thee, inasmuch I have lain in this sea eighteen
                        hundred years and have not seen the face of the world save within this hour. But I would not
                        have thee fish here save once a day." The Ifrit then gave him Godspeed, saying, "Allah grant we
                        meet again," and struck the earth with one foot, whereupon the ground clove asunder and
                        swallowed him up.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman, much marveling at what had happened to him
                        with the Ifrit, took the fish and made for the city, and as soon as he reached home he filled an
                        earthen bowl with water and therein threw the fish, which began to struggle and wriggle about.
                        Then he bore off the bowl upon his head and, repairing to the King's palace (even as the Ifrit
                        had bidden him) laid the fish before the presence. And the King wondered with exceeding wonder
                        at the sight, for never in his lifetime had he seen fishes like these in quality or in
                        conformation. So he said, "Give those fish to the stranger slave girl who now cooketh for us,"
                        meaning the bondmaiden whom the King of Roum had sent to him only three days before, so that he
                        had not yet made trial of her talents in the dressing of meat.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the Wazir carried the fish to the cook and bade
                        her fry them, saying: O damsel, the King sendeth this say to thee: 'I have not treasured thee, O
                        tear o' me! save for stress time of me.' Approve, then, to us this day thy delicate handiwork
                        and thy savory cooking, for this dish of fish is a present sent to the Sultan and evidently a
                        rarity." The Wazir, after he had carefully charged her, returned to the King, who commanded him
                        to give the fisherman four hundred dinars. He gave them accordingly, and the man took them to
                        his bosom and ran off home stumbling and falling and rising again and deeming the whole thing to
                        be a dream. However, he bought for his family all they wanted, and lastly he went to his wife in
                        huge joy and gladness. So far concerning him.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;But as regards the cookmaid, she took the fish and cleansed
                        them and set them in the frying pan, basting them with oil till one side was dressed. Then she
                        turned them over and behold, the kitchen wall clave asunder, and therefrom came a young lady,
                        fair of form, oval of face, perfect in grace, with eyelids which kohl lines enchase. Her dress
                        was a silken headkerchief fringed and tasseled with blue. A large ring hung from either ear, a
                        pair of bracelets adorned her wrists, rings with bezels of priceless gems were on her fingers,
                        and she hent in hand a long rod of rattan cane which she thrust into the frying pan, saying, "O
                        fish! O fish! Be ye constant to your convenant?" When the cookmaiden saw this apparition she
                        swooned away. The young lady repeated her words a second time and a third time, and at last the
                        fishes raised their heads from the pan, and saying in articulate speech, "Yes! Yes!" began with
                        one voice to recite:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back and so will I! Keep faith and
                        so will I!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if ye fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we
                        cry!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;After this the young lady upset the frying pan and went
                        forth by the way she came in and the kitchen wall closed upon her. When the cookmaiden recovered
                        from her fainting fit, she saw the four fishes charred black as charcoal, and crying out, "His
                        staff brake in his first bout," she again fell swooning to the ground. Whilst she was in this
                        case the Wazir came for the fish, and looking upon her as insensible she lay, not knowing Sunday
                        from Thursday, shoved her with his foot and said, "Bring the fish for the Sultan!" Thereupon,
                        recovering from her fainting fit, she wept and informed him of her case and all that had
                        befallen her. The Wazir marveled greatly and exclaiming, "This is none other than a right
                        strange matter!" he sent after the fisher-man and said to him, "Thou, O Fisherman, must needs
                        fetch us four fishes like those thou broughtest before."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the man repaired to the tarn and cast his net,
                        and when he landed it, lo! four fishes were therein exactly like the first. These he at once
                        carried to the Wazir, who went in with them to the cookmaiden and said, "Up with thee and fry
                        these in my presence, that I may see this business." The damsel arose and cleansed the fish, and
                        set them in the frying pan over the fire. However, they remained there but a little while ere
                        the wall clave asunder and the young lady appeared, clad as before and holding in hand the wand
                        which she again thrust into the frying pan, saying, "O fish! O fish! Be ye constant to your
                        olden convenant?" And behold, the fish lifted their heads and repeated "Yes! Yes!" and recited
                        this couplet:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back and so will I! Keep faith and
                        so will I!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if ye fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we
                        cry!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fishes spoke, and the young lady upset the frying
                        pan with her rod and went forth by the way she came and the wall closed up, the Wazir cried out,
                        "This is a thing not to be hidden from the King." So he went and told him what had happened,
                        whereupon quoth the King, "There is no help for it but that I see this with mine own eyes Then
                        he sent for the fisherman and commanded him to bring four other fish like the first and to take
                        with him three men as witnesses. The fisherman at once brought the fish, and the King, after
                        ordering them to give him four hundred gold pieces, turned to the Wazir and said, "Up, and fry
                        me the fishes here before me!" The Minister, replying, "To hear is to obey," bade bring the
                        frying pan, threw therein the cleansed fish, and set it over the fire, when lo! the wall clave
                        asunder, and out burst a black slave like a huge rock or a remnant of the tribe Ad, bearing in
                        hand a branch of a green tree. And he cried in loud and terrible tones, "O fish! O fish! Be ye
                        an constant to your antique convenant?" Whereupon the fishes lifted their heads from the frying
                        pan and said, "Yes! Yes! We be true to our vow," and they again recited the couplet:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back and so will I! Keep faith and
                        so will I!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if ye fain forsake, I'll requite till quits we
                        cry!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the huge blackamoor approached the frying pan and
                        upset it with the branch and went forth by the way he came in. When he vanished from their
                        sight, the King inspected the fish, and finding them all charred black as charcoal, was utterly
                        bewildered, and said to the Wazir: "Verily this is a matter whereanent silence cannot be kept.
                        And as for the fishes, assuredly some marvelous adventure connects with them." So he bade bring
                        the fisherman and asked him, saying: "Fie on thee, fellow! Whence come these fishes?" And he
                        answered, "From a tarn between four heights lying behind this mountain which is in sight of thy
                        city." Quoth the King, "How many days' march?" Quoth he, "O our Lord the Sultan, a walk of
                        half-hour." The King wondered, and straightway ordering his men to march and horsemen to mount,
                        led off the fisherman, who went before as guide, privily damning the Ifrit.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;They fared on till they had climbed the mountain and
                        descended unto a great desert which they had never seen during all their lives. And the Sultan
                        and his merry men marveled much at the wold set in the midst of four mountains, and the tarn and
                        its fishes of four colors, red and white, yellow and blue. The King stood fixed to the spot in
                        wonderment and asked his troops and an present, "Hath anyone among you ever seen this piece of
                        water before now?" And all made answer, "O King of the Age, never did we set eyes upon it during
                        an our days." They also questioned the oldest inhabitants they met, men well stricken in years,
                        but they replied, each and every, "A lakelet like this we never saw in this place." Thereupon
                        quoth the King, "By Allah, I will neither return to my capital nor sit upon the throne of my
                        forebears till I learn the truth about this tarn and the fish therein."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;He then ordered his men to dismount and bivouac all around
                        the mountain, which they did, and summoning his Wazir, a Minister of much experience, sagacious,
                        of penetrating wit and well versed in affairs, said to him: "'Tis in my mind to do a certain
                        thing, whereof I will inform thee. My heart telleth me to fare forth alone this night and root
                        out the mystery of this tarn and its fishes. Do thou take thy scat at my tent door, and say to
                        the emirs and wazirs, the nabobs and the chamberlains, in fine, to all who ask thee, 'The Sultan
                        is ill at ease, and he hath ordered me to refuse all admittance.' And be careful thou let none
                        know my design." And the Wazir could not oppose him. Then the King changed his dress and
                        ornaments and, slinging his sword over his shoulder, took a path which led up one of the
                        mountains and marched for the rest of the night till morning dawned, nor did he cease wayfaring
                        till the heat was too much for him. After his long walk he rested for a while, and then resumed
                        his march and fared on through the second night till dawn, when suddenly there appeared a black
                        point in the far distance. Hereat he rejoiced and said to himself, "Haply someone here shall
                        acquaint me with the mystery of the tarn and its fishes."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, drawing near the dark object, he found it a
                        palace built of swart stone plated with iron, and while one leaf of the gate stood wide-open,
                        the other was shut. The King's spirits rose high as he stood before the gate and rapped a light
                        rap, but hearing no answer, he knocked a second knock and a third, yet there came no sign. Then
                        he knocked his loudest, but still no answer, so he said, "Doubtless 'tis empty." There upon he
                        mustered up resolution and boldly walked through the main gate into the great hall, and there
                        cried out aloud: "Holloa, ye people of the palace! I am a stranger and a wayfarer. Have you
                        aught here of victual?" He repeated his cry a second time and a third, but still there came no
                        reply.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;So, strengthening his heart and making up his mind, he
                        stalked through the vestibule into the very middle of the palace, and found no man in it. Yet it
                        was furnished with silken stuffs gold-starred, and the hangings were let down over the doorways.
                        In the midst was a spacious court off which sat four open saloons, each with its raised dais,
                        saloon facing saloon. A canopy shaded the court, and in the center was a jetting fount with four
                        figures of lions made of red gold, spouting from their mouths water clear as pearls and
                        diaphanous gems. Round about the palace birds were let loose, and over it stretched a net of
                        golden wire, hindering them from flying off. In brief, there was everything but human beings.
                        The King marveled mightily thereat, yet felt he sad at heart for that he saw no one to give him
                        an account of the waste and its tarn, the fishes, the mountains, and the palace itself.
                        Presently as he sat between the doors in deep thought behold, there came a voice of lament, as
                        from a heart griefspent, and he heard the voice chanting these verses:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hid what I endured of him and yet it came to
                        light,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nightly sleep mine eyelids fled and changed to sleepless
                        night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O world! O Fate! Withhold thy hand and cease thy hurt and
                        harm<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look and behold my hapless sprite in dolor and
                        affright.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt ne'er show ruth to highborn youth who lost him on the
                        way<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Love, and fell from wealth and fame to lowest basest
                        wight?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jealous of Zephyr's breath was I as on your form he
                        breathed,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whenas Destiny descends she blindeth human
                        sight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall the hapless archer do who when he fronts his
                        foe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bends his bow to shoot the shaft shall find his string
                        undight?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cark and care so heavy bear on youth of generous
                        soul,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall he 'scape his lot and where from Fate his place of flight?"
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the Sultan heard the mournful voice he sprang to
                        his feet and following the sound, found a curtain let down over a chamber door. He raised it and
                        saw behind it a young man sitting upon a couch about a cubit above the ground, and he fair to
                        the sight, a well-shaped wight, with eloquence dight. His forehead was flower-white, his cheek
                        rosy bright, and a mole on his cheek breadth like an ambergris mite, even as the poet doth
                        indite:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth slim-waisted from whose locks and
                        brow<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world in blackness and in light is
                        set.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout Creation's round no fairer
                        show<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No rarer sight thine eye hath ever
                        met.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nut-brown mole sits throned upon a
                        cheek<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rosiest red beneath an eye of jet.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The King rejoiced and saluted him, but he remained sitting
                        in his caftan of silken stuff purfled with Egyptian gold and his crown studded with gems of
                        sorts. But his face was sad with the traces of sorrow. He returned the royal salute in most
                        courteous wise adding, "O my lord, thy dignity demandeth my rising to thee, and my sole excuse
                        is to crave thy pardon." Quoth the King: "Thou art excused, O youth, so look upon me as thy
                        guest come hither on an especial object. I would thou acquaint me with the secrets of this tarn
                        and its fishes and of this palace and thy loneliness therein and the cause of thy groaning and
                        wailing." When the young man heard these words he wept with sore weeping till his bosom was
                        drenched with tears. The King marveled and asked him, "What maketh thee weep, O young man?" and
                        he answered, "How should I not weep, when this is my case!" Thereupon he put out his hand and
                        raised the skirt of his garment, when lo! the lower half of him appeared stone down to his feet
                        while from his navel to the hair of his head he was man. The King, seeing this his plight,
                        grieved with sore grief and of his compassion cried: "Alack and wellaway! In very sooth, O
                        youth, thou heapest sorrow upon my sorrow. I was minded to ask thee the mystery of the fishes
                        only, whereas now I am concerned to learn thy story as well as theirs. But there is no Majesty
                        and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Lose no time, O youth, but tell me
                        forthright thy whole tale." Quoth he, "Lend me thine ears, thy sight, and thine insight." And
                        quoth the King, "All are at thy service!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the youth began, "Right wondrous and marvelous is
                        my case and that of these fishes, and were it graven with gravers upon the eye corners it were a
                        warner to whoso would be warned." "How is that?" asked the King, and the young man began to tell

                        <h1>THE PORTER AND THE THREE LADIES OF BAGHDAD</h1>
                    </center>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;ONCE upon a time there was a porter in Baghdad who was a
                        bachelor and who would remain unmarried. It came to pass on a certain day, as he stood about the
                        street leaning idly upon his crate, behold, there stood before him an honorable woman in a
                        mantilla of Mosul silk broidered with gold and bordered with brocade. Her walking shoes were
                        also purred with gold, and her hair floated in long plaits. She raised her face veil and,
                        showing two black eyes fringed with jetty lashes, whose glances were soft and languishing and
                        whose perfect beauty was ever blandishing, she accosted the porter and said in the suavest tones
                        and choicest language, "Take up thy crate and follow me."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The porter was so dazzled he could hardly believe that he
                        heard her aright, but he shouldered his basket in hot haste, saying in himself, "O day of good
                        luck! O day of Allah's grace!" and walked after her till she stopped at the door of a house.
                        There she rapped, and presently came out to her an old man, a Nazarene, to whom she gave a gold
                        piece, receiving from him in return what she required of strained wine clear as olive oil, and
                        she set it safely in the hamper, saying, "Lift and follow." Quoth the porter, "This, by Allah,
                        is indeed an auspicious day, a day propitious for the granting of all a man wisheth." He again
                        hoisted up the crate and followed her till she stopped at a fruiterer's shop and bought from him
                        Shami apples and Osmani quinces and Omani peaches, and cucumbers of Nile growth, and Egyptian
                        limes and Sultani oranges and citrons, besides Aleppine jasmine, scented myrtle berries,
                        Damascene nenuphars, flower of privet and camomile, blood-red anemones, violets, and pomegranate
                        bloom, eglantine, and narcissus, and set the whole in the porter's crate, saying, "Up with it."
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;So he lifted and followed her till she stopped at a
                        butcher's booth and said, "Cut me off ten pounds of mutton." She paid him his price and he
                        wrapped it in a banana leaf, whereupon she laid it in the crate and said, "Hoist, O Porter." He
                        hoisted accordingly, and followed her as she walked on till she stopped at a grocer's, where she
                        bought dry fruits and pistachio kernels, Tihamah raisins, shelled almonds, and all wanted for
                        dessert, and said to the porter, "Lift and follow me." So he up with his hamper and after her
                        till she stayed at the confectioner's, and she bought an earthen platter, and piled it with all
                        kinds of sweetmeats in his shop, open-worked tarts and fritters scented with musk, and "soap
                        cakes," and lemon loaves, and melon preserves, and "Zaynab's combs," and "ladies' fingers," and
                        "Kazi's titbits," and goodies of every description, and placed the platter in the porter's
                        crate. Thereupon quoth he (being a merry man), "Thou shouldest have told me, and I would have
                        brought with me a pony or a she-camel to carry all this market stuff." She smiled and gave him a
                        little cuff on the nape, saying, "Step out and exceed not in words, for (Allah willing!) thy
                        wage will not be wanting."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she stopped at a perfumer's and took from him ten
                        sorts of waters, rose scented with musk, orange-flower, water-lily, willow-flower, violet and
                        five others. And she also bought two loaves of sugar, a bottle for perfume-spraying, a lump of
                        male incense, aloe wood, ambergris, and musk, with candles of Alexandria wax, and she put the
                        whole into the basket, saying, "Up with thy crate and after me." He did so and followed until
                        she stood before the greengrocer's, of whom she bought pickled sallower and olives, in brine and
                        in oil, with tarragon and cream cheese and hard Syrian cheese, and she stowed them away in the
                        crate, saying to the porter, "Take up thy basket and follow me." He did so and went after her
                        till she came to a fair mansion fronted by a spacious court, a tall, fine place to which columns
                        gave strength and grace. And the gate thereof had two leaves of ebony inlaid with plates of red
                        gold. The lady stopped at the door and, turning her face veil sideways, knocked softly with her
                        knuckles whilst the porter stood behind her, thinking of naught save her beauty and loveliness.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently the door swung back and both leaves were opened,
                        whereupon he looked to see who had opened it, and behold, it was a lady of tall figure, some
                        five feet high, a model of beauty and loveliness, brilliance and symmetry and perfect grace. Her
                        forehead was flower-white, her cheeks like the anemone ruddy-bright. Her eyes were those of the
                        wild heifer or the gazelle, with eyebrows like the crescent moon which ends Sha'aban and begins
                        Ramazan. Her mouth was the ring of Solomon, her lips coral-red, and her teeth like a line of
                        strung pearls or of camomile petals. Her throat recalled the antelope's, and her breasts, like
                        two pomegranates of even size, stood at bay as it were. Her body rose and fell in waves below
                        her dress like the rolls of a piece of brocade, and her navel would hold an ounce of benzoin
                        ointment. In fine, she was like her of whom the poet said:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sun and Moon of palace cast thy
                        sight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy her flowerlike face, her fragrant
                        light.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine eyes shall never see in hair so
                        black<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty encase a brow so purely
                        white.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruddy rosy cheek proclaims her
                        claim,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though fail her name whose beauties we
                        indite.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sways her gait, I smile at hips so
                        big<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weep to see the waist they bear so slight.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the porter looked upon her, his wits were waylaid and
                        his senses were stormed so that his crate went nigh to fall from his head, and he said to
                        himself, "Never have I in my life seen a day more blessed than this day!" Then quoth the lady
                        portress to the lady cateress, "Come in from the gate and relieve this poor man of his load." So
                        the provisioner went in, followed by the portress and the porter, and went on till they reached
                        a spacious ground-floor hall, built with admirable skill and beautified with all manner colors
                        and carvings, with upper balconies and groined arches and galleries and cupboards and recesses
                        whose curtains hung before them. In the midst stood a great basin full of water surrounding a
                        fine fountain, and at the upper end on the raised dais was a couch of juniper wood set with gems
                        and pearls, with a canopy like mosquito curtains of red satin-silk looped up with pearls as big
                        as filberts and bigger.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon sat a lady bright of blee, with brow beaming
                        brilliancy, the dream of philosophy, whose eyes were fraught with Babel's gramarye and her
                        eyebrows were arched as for archery. Her breath breathed ambergris and perfumery and her lips
                        were sugar to taste and carnelian to see. Her stature was straight as the letter l and her face
                        shamed the noon sun's radiancy; and she was even as a galaxy, or a dome with golden marquetry,
                        or a bride displayed in choicest finery, or a noble maid of Araby. The third lady, rising from
                        the couch, stepped forward with graceful swaying gait till she reached the middle of the saloon,
                        when she said to her sisters: "Why stand ye here? Take it down from this poor man's head!" Then
                        the cateress went and stood before him and the portress behind him while the third helped them,
                        and they lifted the load from the porter's head, and, emptying it of all that was therein, set
                        everything in its place. Lastly they gave him two gold pieces, saying, "Wend thy ways, O
                        Porter."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;But he went not, for he stood looking at the ladies and
                        admiring what uncommon beauty was theirs, and their pleasant manners and kindly dispositions
                        (never had he seen goodlier). And he gazed wistfully at that good store of wines and
                        sweet-scented flowers and fruits and other matters. Also he marveled with exceeding marvel,
                        especially to see no man in the place, and delayed his going, whereupon quoth the eldest lady:
                        "What aileth thee that goest not? Haply thy wage be too little?" And, turning to her sister, the
                        cateress, she said, "Give him another dinar!" But the porter answered: "By Allah, my lady, it is
                        not for the wage, my hire is never more than two dirhams, but in very sooth my heart and my soul
                        are taken up with you and your condition. I wonder to see you single with ne'er a man about you
                        and not a soul to bear you company. And well you wot that the minaret toppleth o'er unless it
                        stand upon four, and you want this same fourth, and women's pleasure without man is short of
                        measure, even as the poet said:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seest not we want for joy four things
                        all told-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harp and lute, the flute and
                        flageolet-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be they companied with scents
                        fourfold,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, myrtle, anemone, and
                        violet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor please all eight an four thou wouldst
                        withhold-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good wine and youth and gold and pretty pet.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;"You be three and want a fourth who shall be a person of
                        good sense and prudence, smart-witted, and one apt to keep careful counsel." His words pleased
                        and amused them much, and they laughed at him and said: "And who is to assure us of that? We are
                        maidens, and we fear to entrust our secret where it may not be kept, for we have read in a
                        certain chronicle the lines of one Ibn al-Sumam:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold fast thy secret and to none
                        unfold,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost is a secret when that secret's
                        told.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An fail thy breast thy secret to
                        conceal,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How canst thou hope another's breast shall hold?"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">When the porter heard their words, he rejoined: "By your lives! I am a
                        man of sense and a discreet, who hath read books and perused chronicles. I reveal the fair and
                        conceal the foul and I act as the poet adviseth:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"None but the good a secret
                        keep,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And good men keep it
                        unrevealed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to me a well-shut
                        house<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With keyless locks and door ensealed."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the maidens heard his verse and its poetical
                        application addressed to them, they said: "Thou knowest that we have laid out all our moneys on
                        this place. Now say, hast thou aught to offer us in return for entertainment? For surely we will
                        not suffer thee to sit in our company and be our cup companion, and gaze upon our faces so fair
                        and so rare, without paying a round sum. Wettest thou not the saying:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sans hope of
                        gain<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's not worth
                        a grain"?</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Whereto the lady portress added, "If thou bring anything, thou art a
                        something; if no thing, be off with thee, thou art a nothing." But the procuratrix interposed,
                        saying: "Nay, O my sisters, leave teasing him, for by Allah he hath not failed us this day, and
                        had he been other he never had kept patience with me, so whatever be his shot and scot I will
                        take it upon myself."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The porter, overjoyed, kissed the ground before her and
                        thanked her, saying, "By Allah, these moneys are the first fruits this day hath given me."
                        Hearing this, they said, "Sit thee down and welcome to thee," and the eldest lady added: "By
                        Allah, we may not suffer thee to join us save on one condition, and this it is, that no
                        questions be asked as to what concerneth thee not, and frowardness shall be soundly flogged."
                        Answered the porter: "I agree to this, O my lady. On my head and my eyes be it! Look ye, I am
                        dumb, I have no tongue." Then arose the provisioneress and, tightening her girdle, set the table
                        by the fountain and put the flowers and sweet herbs in their jars, and strained the wine and
                        ranged the flasks in rows and made ready every requisite. Then sat she down, she and her
                        sisters, placing amidst them the porter, who kept deeming himself in a dream. And she took up
                        the wine flagon and poured out the first cup and drank it off, and likewise a second and a
                        third. After this she filled a fourth cup, which she handed to one of her sisters, and lastly,
                        she crowned a goblet and passed it to the porter, saying:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink the dear draught, drink free and
                        fain<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What healeth every grief and pain."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the cup in his hand and, Touting low, returned his
                        best thanks and improvised:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drain not the bowl save with a trusty
                        friend,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of worth whose good old blood all
                        know.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For wine, like wind, sucks sweetness from the
                        sweet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stinks when over stench it haply blow."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Adding:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drain not the bowl, save from dear hand
                        like thine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup recalls thy gifts, thou, gifts of wine."
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">After repeating this couplet he kissed their hands and drank and was
                        drunk and sat swaying from side to side and pursued:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All drinks wherein is blood the Law
                        unclean<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth hold save one, the bloodshed of the
                        vine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill! Fill! Take all my wealth bequeathed or
                        won,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou fawn! a willing ransome for those eyne."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the cateress crowned a cup and gave it to the
                        portress, who took it from her hand and thanked her and drank. Thereupon she poured again and
                        passed to the eldest lady, who sat on the couch, and filled yet another and handed it to the
                        porter. He kissed the ground before them, and after drinking and thanking them, he again began
                        to recite:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here!
                        Here! By Allah, here!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cups of the
                        sweet, the dear!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill me a
                        brimming bowl,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fount o' Life
                        I speer."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Then the porter stood up before the mistress of the house and said, "O
                        lady, I am thy slave, thy Mameluke, thy white thrall, thy very bondsman," and he began reciting:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A slave of slaves there standeth at thy
                        door,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauding thy generous boons and gifts
                        galore.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty! May he come in awhile to
                        'joy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy charms? For Love and I part nevermore!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the lady took the cup and drank it off to her sisters'
                        health, and they ceased not drinking (the porter being in the midst of them) and dancing and
                        laughing and reciting verses and singing ballads and ritornellos. All this time the porter was
                        carrying on with them, kissing, toying, biting, handling, groping, fingering whilst one thrust a
                        dainty morsel in his mouth and another slapped him, and this cuffed his cheeks, and that threw
                        sweet flowers at him. And he was in the very paradise of pleasure, as though he were sitting in
                        the seventh sphere among the houris of Heaven. And they ceased not to be after this fashion till
                        night began to fall. Thereupon said they to the porter, "Bismillah, O our master, up and on with
                        those sorry old shoes of thine and turn thy face and show us the breadth of thy shoulders!" Said
                        he: "By Allah, to part with my soul would be easier for me than departing from you. Come, let us
                        join night to day, and tomorrow morning we will each wend our own way." "My life on you," said
                        the procuratrix, "suffer him to tarry with us, that we may laugh at him. We may live out our
                        lives and never meet with his like, for surely he is a right merry rogue and a witty." So they
                        said: "Thou must not remain with us this night save on condition that thou submit to our
                        commands, and that whatso thou seest, thou ask no questions thereanent, nor inquire of its
                        cause." "All right," rejoined he, and they said, "Go read the writing over the door."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;So he rose and went to the entrance and there found written
                        in letters of gold wash: WHOSO SPEAKETH OF WHAT CONCERNETH HIM NOT SHALL HEAR WHAT PLEASETH HIM
                        NOT! The porter said, "Be ye witnesses against me that I will not speak on whatso concerneth me
                        not." Then the cateress arose and set food before them and they ate. After which they changed
                        their drinking place for another, and she lighted the lamps and candles and burned ambergris and
                        aloe wood, and set on fresh fruit and the wine service, when they fell to carousing and talking
                        of their lovers. And they ceased not to eat and drink and chat, nibbling dry fruits and laughing
                        and playing tricks for the space of a full hour, when lo! a knock was heard at the gate.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The knocking in no wise disturbed the seance, but one of
                        them rose and went to see what it was and presently returned, saying, "Truly our pleasure for
                        this night is to be perfect." "How is that?" asked they, and she answered: "At the gate be three
                        Persian Kalandars with their beards and heads and eyebrows shaven, and all three blind of the
                        left eye- which is surely a strange chance. They are foreigners from Roumland with the mark of
                        travel plain upon them. They have just entered Baghdad, this being their first visit to our
                        city, and the cause of their knocking at our door is simply because they cannot find a lodging.
                        Indeed one of them said to me: 'Haply the owner of this mansion will let us have the key of his
                        stable or some old outhouse wherein we may pass this night.' For evening had surprised them and,
                        being strangers in the land, they knew none who would give them shelter. And, O my sisters, each
                        of them is a figure o' fun after his own fashion, and if we let them in we shall have matter to
                        make sport of." She gave not over persuading them till they said to her: "Let them in, and make
                        thou the usual condition with them that they speak not of what concerneth them not, lest they
                        hear what pleased them not."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;So she rejoiced and, going to the door, presently returned
                        with the three monoculars whose beards and mustachios were clean-shaven. They salaamed and stood
                        afar off by way of respect, but the three ladies rose up to them and welcomed them and wished
                        them joy of their safe arrival and made them sit down. The Kalandars looked at the room and saw
                        that it was a pleasant place, clean-swept and garnished with flowers, and the lamps were burning
                        and the smoke of perfumes was spiring in air, and beside the dessert and fruits and wine, there
                        were three fair girls who might be maidens. So they exclaimed with one voice, "By Allah, 'tis
                        good!" Then they turned to the porter and saw that he was a merry-faced wight, albeit he was by
                        no means sober and was sore after his slappings. So they thought that he was one of themselves
                        and said, "A mendicant like us, whether Arab or foreigner!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the porter heard these words, he rose up and,
                        fixing his eyes fiercely upon them, said: "Sit ye here without exceeding in talk! Have you not
                        read what is writ over the door? Surely it befitteth not fellows who come to us like paupers to
                        wag your tongues at us." "We crave thy pardon, O Fakir," rejoined they, "and our heads are
                        between thy hands." The ladies laughed consumedly at the squabble and, making peace between the
                        Kalandars and the porter, seated the new guests before meat, and they ate. Then they sat
                        together, and the portress served them with drink, and as the cup went round merrily, quoth the
                        porter to the askers, "And you, O brothers mine, have ye no story or rare adventure to amuse us
                        withal?"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the warmth of wine having mounted to their heads, they
                        called for musical instruments, and the portress brought them a tambourine of Mosul, and a lute
                        of Irak, and a Persian harp. And each mendicant took one and tuned it, this the tambourine and
                        those the lute and the harp, and struck up a merry tune while the ladies sang so lustily that
                        there was a great noise. And whilst they were carrying on, behold, someone knocked at the gate,
                        and the portress went to see what was the matter there.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the cause of that knocking, O King (quoth Scheherazade)
                        was this, the Caliph Harun al-Rashid had gone forth from the palace, as was his wont now and
                        then, to solace himself in the city that night, and to see and hear what new thing was stirring.
                        He was in merchant's gear, and he was attended by Ja'afar, his Wazir, and by Masrur, his Sworder
                        of Vengeance. As they walked about the city, their way led them toward the house of the three
                        ladies, where they heard the loud noise of musical instruments and singing and merriment. So
                        quoth the Caliph to Ja'afar, "I long to enter this house and hear those songs and see who sing
                        them." Quoth Ja'afar, "O Prince of the Faithful, these folk are surely drunken with wine, and I
                        fear some mischief betide us if we get amongst them." "There is no help but that I go in there,"
                        replied the Caliph, "and I desire thee to contrive some pretext for our appearing among them."
                        Ja'afar replied, "I hear and I obey," and knocked at the door, whereupon the portress came out
                        and opened. Then Ja'afar came forward and, kissing the ground before her, said, "O my lady, we
                        be merchants from Tiberias town. We arrived at Baghdad ten days ago and, alighting at the
                        merchants' caravanserai, we sold all our merchandise. Now a certain trader invited us to an
                        entertainment this night, so we went to his house and he set food before us and we ate. Then we
                        sat at wine and wassail with him for an hour or so when he gave us leave to depart. And we went
                        out from him in the shadow of the night and, being strangers, we could not find our way back to
                        our khan. So haply of your kindness and courtesy you will suffer us to tarry with you this
                        night, and Heaven will reward you!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;The portress looked upon them and, seeing them dressed like
                        merchants and men of gave looks and solid, she returned to her sisters and repeated to them
                        Ja'afar's story, and they took compassion upon the strangers and said to her, "Let them enter."
                        She opened the door to them, when said they to her, "Have we thy leave to come in?" "Come in,"
                        quoth she, and the Caliph entered, followed by Ja'afar and Masrur. And when the girls saw them
                        they stood up to them in respect and made them sit down and looked to their wants, saying,
                        "Welcome, and well come and good cheer to the guests, but with one condition!" "What is that?"
                        asked they, and one of the ladies answered, "Speak not of what concerneth you not, lest ye hear
                        what pleaseth you not." "Even so," said they, and sat down to their wine and drank deep.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently the Caliph looked on the three Kalandars and,
                        seeing them, each and every blind of the left eye, wondered at the sight. Then he gazed upon the
                        girls, and he was startled and he marveled with exceeding marvel at their beauty and loveliness.
                        They continued to carouse and to converse, and said to the Caliph, "Drink!" But he replied, "I
                        am vowed to pilgrimage," and drew back from the wine. Thereupon the portress rose and, spreading
                        before him a tablecloth worked with gold, set thereon a porcelain bowl into which she poured
                        willow-flower water with a lump of snow and a spoonful of sugar candy. The Caliph thanked her
                        and said in himself, "By Allah, I will recompense her tomorrow for the kind deed she hath done."
                        The others again addressed themselves to conversing and carousing, and when the wine gat the
                        better of them, the eldest lady, who ruled the house, rose and, making obeisance to them, took
                        the cateress by the hand and said, "Rise, O my sister, and let us do what is our devoir." Both
                        answered "Even so!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the portress stood up and proceeded to remove the
                        table service and the remnants of the banquet, and renewed the pastilies and cleared the middle
                        of the saloon. Then she made the Kalandars sit upon a sofa at the side of the estrade, and
                        seated the Caliph and Ja'afar and Masrur on the other side of the saloon, after which she called
                        the porter, and said: "How scant is thy courtesy! Now thou art no stranger- nay, thou art one of
                        the household." So he stood up and, tightening his waistcloth, asked, "What would ye I do?" And
                        she answered, "Stand in thy place." Then the procuratrix rose and set in the midst of the saloon
                        a low chair and, opening a closet, cried to the porter, "Come help me."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;So he went to help her and saw two black bitches with
                        chains round their necks, and she said to him, "Take hold of them," and he took them and led
                        them into the middle of the saloon. Then the lady of the house arose and tucked up her sleeves
                        above her wrists and, seizing a scourge, said to the porter, "Bring forward one of the bitches."
                        He brought her forward, dragging her by the chain, while the bitch wept and shook her head at
                        the lady, who, however, came down upon her with blows on the sconce. And the bitch howled and
                        the lady ceased not beating her till her forearm failed her. Then, casting the scourge from her
                        hand, she pressed the bitch to her bosom and, wiping away her tears with her hands, kissed her
                        head. Then said she to the porter, "Take her away and bring the second." And when he brought
                        her, she did with her as she had done with the first.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the heart of the Caliph was touched at these cruel
                        doings. His chest straitened and he lost all patience in his desire to know why the two bitches
                        were so beaten. He threw a wink at Ja'afar, wishing him to ask, but the Minister, turning toward
                        him, said by signs, "Be silent!" Then quoth the portress to the mistress of the house, "O my
                        lady, arise and go to thy place, that I in turn may do my devoir." She answered, "Even so," and,
                        taking her seat upon the couch of juniper wood, pargetted with gold and silver, said to the
                        portress and cateress, "Now do ye what ye have to do." Thereupon the portress sat upon a low
                        seat by the couch side, but the procuratrix, entering a closet, brought out of it a bag of satin
                        with green fringes and two tassels of gold. She stood up before the lady of the house and,
                        shaking the bag, drew out from it a lute which she tuned by tightening its pegs; and when it was
                        in perfect order, she began to sing these quatrains:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye
                        are the wish, the aim of
                        me,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when, O love, thy
                        sight I see,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavenly
                        mansion openeth,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hell I
                        see when lost thy
                        sight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thee comes
                        madness, nor the less<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes
                        highest joy, comes
                        ecstasy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in my love for
                        thee I fear<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or shame and
                        blame, or hate and
                        spite.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Love was
                        throned within my heart<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
                        rent the veil of
                        modesty,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stints not
                        Love to rend that
                        veil,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garring disgrace on
                        grace to alight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robe
                        of sickness then I
                        donned,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But rent to rags
                        was secrecy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore my
                        love and longing

                        oblivion will I flee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love
                        is my health, my faith, my
                        joy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public and private,
                        wrong or right.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O happy
                        eyes that sight thy
                        charms,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gaze upon thee

                        purest wish and will<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
                        slave of Love I'll aye be hight."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the damsel heard this elegy in quatrains, she cried
                        out "Alas! Alas!" and rent her raiment, and fell to the ground fainting. And the Caliph saw
                        scars of the palm rod on her back and welts of the whip, and marveled with exceeding wonder.
                        Then the portress arose and sprinkled water on her and brought her a fresh and very fine dress
                        and put it on her. But when the company beheld these doings, their minds were troubled, for they
                        had no inkling of the case nor knew the story thereof. So the Caliph said to Ja'afar: "Didst
                        thou not see the scars upon the damsel's body? I cannot keep silence or be at rest till I learn
                        the truth of her condition and the story of this other maiden and the secret of the two black
                        bitches." But Ja'afar answered: "O our lord, they made it a condition with us that we speak not
                        of what concerneth us not, lest we come to hear what pleaseth us not."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the portress, "By Allah, O my sister, come to me
                        and complete this service for me." Replied the procuratrix, "With joy and goodly gree." So she
                        took the lute and leaned it against her breasts and swept the strings with her finger tips, and
                        began singing:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give back mine eyes their sleep long
                        ravished,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And say me whither be my reason
                        fled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learnt that lending to thy love a
                        place,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep to mine eyelids mortal foe was
                        made.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, `We held thee righteous. Who
                        waylaid<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy soul?' 'Go ask his glorious eyes,' I
                        said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pardon all my blood he pleased to
                        shed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owning his troubles drove him blood to
                        shed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my mind's mirror sunlike sheen he
                        cast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose keen reflection fire in vitals
                        bred.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waters of Life let Allah waste at
                        will,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice my wage those lips of dewy
                        red.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou address my love thou'lt find a
                        cause<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For plaint and tears or ruth or
                        lustilied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In water pure his form shall greet your
                        eyne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fails the bowl nor need ye drink of wine."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Then she quoted from the same ode:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I drank, but the draught of his glance,
                        not wine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his swaying gait swayed to sleep these
                        eyne.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas not grape juice gript me but grasp of
                        Past,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas not bowl o'erbowled me but gifts
                        divine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His coiling curllets my soul
                        ennetted<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his cruel will all my wits outwitted."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">After a pause she resumed:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we 'plain of absence, what shall we
                        say?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if pain afflict us, where wend our
                        way?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An I hire a truchman to tell my
                        tale,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovers' plaint is not told for
                        pay.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I put on patience, a lover's
                        life<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After loss of love will not last a
                        day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught is left me now but regret,
                        repine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears flooding cheeks forever and
                        aye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou who the babes of these eyes hast
                        fled,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art homed in heart that shall never
                        stray.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would Heaven I wot hast thou kept our
                        pact<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long as stream shall flow, to have firmest
                        fay?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hast forgotten the weeping
                        slave,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom groans afflict and whom griefs
                        waylay?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, when severance ends and we side by
                        side<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couch, I'll blame thy rigors and chide thy pride!"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the portress heard her second ode, she shrieked
                        aloud and said: "By Allah! 'Tis right good!" and, laying hands on her garments, tore them as she
                        did the first time, and fell to the ground fainting. Thereupon the procuratrix rose and brought
                        her a second change of clothes after she had sprinkled water on her. She recovered and sat
                        upright and said to her sister the cateress, "Onward, and help me in my duty, for there remains
                        but this one song." So the provisioneress again brought out the lute and began to sing these
                        verses:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long shall last, how long this rigor
                        rife of woe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May not suffice thee all these tears thou seest

                        prolong<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is't not enough to glad the heart of envious
                        foe?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were but this lying world once true to lover
                        heart,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had not watched the weary night in tears of
                        woe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, pity me whom overwhelmed thy cruel
                        will,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lord, my king, 'tis time some ruth to me thou
                        show.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom reveal my wrongs, O thou who murdered
                        me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad, who of broken troth the pangs must
                        undergo!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase wild love for thee and frenzy hour by
                        hour,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And days of exile minute by so long, so
                        slow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Moslems, claim vendetta for this slave of
                        Love,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sleep Love ever wastes, whose patience Love lays
                        low.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth law of Love allow thee, O my wish! to
                        lie<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapt in another's arms and unto me cry
                        'Go!'?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in thy presence, say, what joys shall I
                        enjoy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he I love but works my love to overthrow?"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the portress heard the third song, she cried aloud
                        and, laying hands on her garments, rent them down to the very skirt and fell to the ground
                        fainting a third time, again showing the scars of the scourge. Then said the three Kalandars,
                        "Would Heaven we had never entered this house, but had rather nighted on the mounds and heaps
                        outside the city! For verily our visit hath been troubled by sights which cut to the heart." The
                        Caliph turned to them and asked, "Why so?" and they made answer, "Our minds are sore troubled by
                        this matter." Quoth the Caliph, "Are ye not of the household?" and quoth they, "No, nor indeed
                        did we ever set eyes on the place till within this hour." Hereat the Caliph marveled and
                        rejoined, "This man who sitteth by you, would he not know the secret of the matter?" And so
                        saying he winked and made signs at the porter. So they questioned the man, but he replied: "By
                        the All-might of Allah, in love all are alike! I am the growth of Baghdad, yet never in my born
                        days did I darken these doors till today, and my companying with them was a curious matter." "By
                        Allah," they rejoined, "we took thee for one of them and now we see thou art one like
                        ourselves."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the Caliph: "We be seven men, and they only three
                        women without even a fourth to help them, so let us question them of their case. And if they
                        answer us not, fain we will be answered by force." All of them agreed to this except Ja'afar,
                        who said, "This is not my recking. Let them be, for we are their guests and, as ye know, they
                        made a compact and condition with us which we accepted and promised to keep. Wherefore it is
                        better that we be silent concerning this matter, and as but little of the night remaineth, let
                        each and every of us gang his own gait." Then he winked at the Caliph and whispered to him,
                        "There is but one hour of darkness left and I can bring them before thee tomorrow, when thou
                        canst freely question them all concerning their story." But the Caliph raised his head haughtily
                        and cried out at him in wrath, saying: "I have no patience left for my longing to hear of them.
                        Let the Kalandars question them forthright." Quoth Ja'afar, "This is not my rede."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then words ran high and talk answered talk, and they
                        disputed as to who should first put the question, but at last all fixed upon the porter. And as
                        the jangle increased the house mistress could not but notice it and asked them, "O ye folk! On
                        what matter are ye talking so loudly?" Then the porter stood up respectfully before her and
                        said: "O my lady, this company earnestly desire that thou acquaint them with story of the two
                        bitches and what maketh thee punish them so cruelly, and then thou fallest to weeping over them
                        and kissing them. And lastly, they want to hear the tale of thy sister and why she hath been
                        bastinadoed with palm sticks like a man. These are the questions they charge me to put, and
                        peace be with thee." Thereupon quoth she who was the lady of the house to the guests, "Is this
                        true that he saith on your part?" and all replied, "Yes!" save Ja'afar, who kept silence.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard these words she cried: "By Allah, ye have
                        wronged us, O our guests, with grievous wronging, for when you came before us we made compact
                        and condition with you that whoso should speak of what concerneth him not should hear what
                        pleaseth him not. Sufficeth ye not that we took you into our house and fed you with our best
                        food? But the fault is not so much yours as hers who let you in." Then she tucked up her sleeves
                        from her wrists and struck the floor thrice with her hand, crying, "Come ye quickly!" And lo! a
                        closet door opened and out of it came seven Negro slaves with drawn swords in hand, to whom she
                        said, "Pinion me those praters' elbows and bind them each to each." They did her bidding and
                        asked her: "O veiled and virtuous! Is it thy high command that we strike off their heads?" But
                        she answered, "Leave them awhile that I question them of their condition before their necks feel
                        the sword." "By Allah, O my lady!" cried the porter, "slay me not for other's sin. All these men
                        offended and deserve the penalty of crime save myself. Now, by Allah, our night had been
                        charming had we escaped the mortification of those monocular Kalandars whose entrance into a
                        populous city would convert it into a howling wilderness." Then he repeated these verses:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How fair is ruth the strong man deigns
                        not smother!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fairest fair when shown to weakest
                        brother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Love's own holy tie between us
                        twain,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let one not suffer for the sin of other."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the porter ended his verse, the lady laughed despite
                        her wrath, and came up to the party and spake thus: "Tell me who ye be, for ye have but an hour
                        of life. And were ye not men of rank and perhaps notables of your tribes, you had not been so
                        froward and I had hastened your doom." Then said the Caliph: "Woe to thee, O Ja'afar, tell her
                        who we are lest we be slain by mistake, and speak her fair before some horror befall us." "'Tis
                        part of thy deserts," replied he, whereupon the Caliph cried out at him, saying, "There is a
                        time for witty words and there is a time for serious work." Then the lady accosted the three
                        Kalandars and asked them, "Are ye brothers?" when they answered, "No, by Allah, we be naught but
                        fakirs and foreigners." Then quoth she to one among them, "Wast thus born blind of one eye?" and
                        quoth he, "No, by Allah, 'twas a marvelous matter and a wondrous mischance which caused my eye
                        to be torn out, and mine is a tale which, if it were written upon the eye corners with needle
                        gravers, were a warner to whoso would be warned." She questioned the second and third Kalandar,
                        but all replied like the first, "By Allah, O our mistress, each one of us cometh from a
                        different country, and we are all three the sons of kings, sovereign princes ruling over
                        suzerains and capital cities."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon she turned toward them and said: "Let each and
                        every of you tell me his tale in due order and explain the cause of his coming to our place, and
                        if his story please us, let him stroke his head and wend his way." The first to come forward was
                        the hammal, the porter, who said: "O my lady, I am a man and a porter. This dame, the cateress,
                        hired me to carry a load and took me first to the shop of a vintner, then to the booth of a
                        butcher, thence to the stall of a fruiterer, thence to a grocer who also sold dry fruits, thence
                        to a confectioner and a perfumer-cum-druggist, and from him to this place, where there happened
                        to me with you what happened. Such is my story, and peace be on us all!" At this the lady
                        laughed and said, "Rub thy head and wend thy ways!" But he cried, "By Allah, I will not stump it
                        till I hear the stories of my companions!" Then came forward one of the monoculars and began to
                        tell her.</p>
                    <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">NOW during this time Scheherazade had borne the King three boy
                        children, so when she had made an end of the story, she rose to her feet and kissing ground
                        before him, said, "O King of the Time and unique one of the Age and the Tide, I am thine
                        handmaid, and these thousand nights and a night have I entertained thee with stories of folk
                        gone before and admonitory instances of the men of yore. May I then make bold to crave a boon of
                        thy Highness?" He replied, "Ask, O Scheherazade, and it shall be granted to thee." Whereupon she
                        cried out to the nurses and the eunuchs, saying, "Bring me my children." So they brought them to
                        her in haste, and they were three boy children, one walking, one crawling, and one suckling. She
                        took them, and setting them before the King, again kissed the ground and said: "O King of the
                        Age, these are thy children, and I crave that thou release me from the doom of death, as a dole
                        to these infants. For an thou kill me, they will become motherless and will find none among
                        women to rear them as they should he reared."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the King heard this, he wept, and straining the boys
                        to his bosom, said: "By Allah, O Scheherazade, I pardoned thee before the coming of these
                        children, for that I found thee chaste, pure, ingenuous, and pious! Allah bless thee and thy
                        father and thy mother and thy root and thy branch! I take the Almighty to witness against me
                        that I exempt thee from aught that can harm thee." So she kissed his hands and feet and rejoiced
                        with exceeding joy, saying, "The Lord make thy life long and increase thee in dignity and
                        majesty!" presently adding: "Thou marveledst at that which befell thee on the part of women; yet
                        there betided the Kings of the Chosroes before thee greater mishaps and more grievous than that
                        which hath befallen thee; and indeed I have set forth unto thee that which happened to caliphs
                        and kings and others with their women, but the relation is longsome and hearkening groweth
                        tedious, and in this is all-sufficient warning for the man of wits and admonishment for the
                        wise."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she ceased to speak, and when King Shahryar heard her
                        speech and profited by that which she said, he summoned up his reasoning powers and cleansed his
                        heart and caused his understanding revert and turned to Allah Almighty and said to himself:
                        "Since there befell the Kings of the Chosroes more than that which hath befallen me, never
                        whilst I live shall I cease to blame myself for the past. As for this Scheherazade, her like is
                        not found in the lands, so praise be to Him who appointed her a means for delivering His
                        creatures from oppression and slaughter!" Then he arose from his seance and kissed her head,
                        whereat she rejoiced, she and her sister Dunyazade, with exceeding joy.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning morrowed, the king went forth and sitting
                        down on the throne of the kingship, summoned the lords of his land, whereupon the chamberlains
                        and nabobs and captains of the host went in to him and kissed ground before him. He
                        distinguished the Wazir, Scheherazade's sire, with special favor and bestowed on him a costly
                        and splendid robe of honor and entreated him with the utmost kindness, and said to him: "Allah
                        protect thee for that thou gavest me to wife thy noble daughter, who hath been the means of my
                        repentance from slaying the daughters of folk. Indeed I have found her pure and pious, chaste
                        and ingenuous, and Allah hath vouchsafed me by her three boy children, wherefore praised be He
                        for his passing favor." Then he bestowed robes of honor upon his wazirs and emirs and chief
                        officers, and he set forth to them briefly that which had betided him with Scheherazade and how
                        he had turned from his former ways and repented him of what he had done and purposed to take the
                        Wazir's daughter, Scheherazade, to wife and let draw up the marriage contract with her. When
                        those who were present heard this, they kissed the ground before him and blessed him and his
                        betrothed Scheherazade, and the Wazir thanked her. Then Shahryar made an end of his sitting in
                        all weal, whereupon the folk dispersed to their dwelling places and the news was bruited abroad
                        that the King purposed to marry the Wazir's daughter, Scheherazade.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he proceeded to make ready the wedding gear, and
                        presently he sent after his brother, King Shah Zaman, who came, and King Shahryar went forth to
                        meet him with the troops. Furthermore, they decorated the city after the goodliest fashion, and
                        diffused scents from censers and burnt aloes wood and other perfumes in all the markets and
                        thoroughfares, and rubbed themselves with saffron, what while the drums beat and the flutes and
                        pipes sounded and mimes and mountebanks played and plied their arts and the King lavished on
                        them gifts and largess. And in very deed it was a notable day. When they came to the palace,
                        King Shahryar commanded to spread the tables with beasts roasted whole and sweetmeats and all
                        manner of viands, and bade the crier cry to the folk that they should come up to the Divan and
                        eat and drink, and that this should be a means of reconciliation between him and them. So high
                        and low, great and small, came up unto him, and they abode on that wise, eating and drinking
                        seven days with their nights.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the King shut himself up with his brother and related
                        to him that which had betided him with the Wazir's daughter, Scheherazade, during the past three
                        years, and told him what he had heard from her of proverbs and parables, chronicles and
                        pleasantries, quips and jests, stories and anecdotes, dialogues and histories and elegies and
                        other verses. Whereat King Shah Zaman marveled with the uttermost marvel and said: "Fain would I
                        take her younger sister to wife, so we may be two brothers german to two sisters german, and
                        they on like wise be sisters to us; for that the calamity which befell me was the cause of our
                        discovering that which befell thee, and all this time of three years past I have taken no
                        delight in woman, save that I lie each night with a damsel of my kingdom, and every morning I do
                        her to death. But now I desire to marry thy wife's sister, Dunyazade."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When King Shahryar heard his brother's words, he rejoiced
                        with joy exceeding and arising forthright, went in to his wife, Scheherazade, and acquainted her
                        with that which his brother purposed, namely that he sought her sister, Dunyazade in wedlock,
                        whereupon she answered: "O King of the Age, we seek of him one condition; to wit, that he take
                        up his abode with us, for that I cannot brook to be parted from my sister an hour, because we
                        were brought up together and may not endure separation each from other. If he accept this pact,
                        she is his handmaid." King Shahryar returned to his brother and acquainted him with that which
                        Scheherazade had said, and he replied: "Indeed, this is what was in my mind, for that I desire
                        nevermore to be parted from thee one hour. As for the kingdom, Allah the Most High shall send to
                        it whomso He chooseth, for that I have no longer a desire for the kinship." When King Shahryar
                        heard his brother's words, he rejoiced exceedingly and said: "Verily, this is what I wished, O
                        my brother. So Alhamdolillah- praised be Allah- who hath brought about union between us."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he sent after the kazis and ulema, captains and
                        notables, and they married the two brothers to the two sisters. The contracts were written out
                        and the two Kings bestowed robes of honor of silk and satin on those who were present, whilst
                        the city was decorated and the rejoicings were renewed. The King commanded each emir and wazir
                        and chamberlain and nabob to decorate his palace, and the folk of the city were gladdened by the
                        presage of happiness and contentment. King Shahryar also bade slaughter sheep and set up
                        kitchens and made bride feasts and fed all comers, high and low; and he gave alms to the poor
                        and needy and extended his bounty to great and small. Then the eunuchs went forth, that they
                        might perfume the hammam for the brides, so they scented it with rose-water and willow-flower
                        water and pods of musk and fumigated it with Kakili eagle wood and ambergris. Then Scheherazade
                        entered, she and her sister Dunyazade, and they cleansed their heads and clipped their hair.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When they came forth of the hammam bath, they donned
                        raiment and ornaments such as men were wont prepare for the Kings of the Chosroes; and among
                        Scheherazade's apparel was a dress purfled with red gold and wrought with counterfeit
                        presentments of birds and beasts. And the two sisters encircled their necks with necklaces of
                        jewels of price, in the like whereof Iskandar rejoiced not, for therein were great jewels such
                        as amazed the wit and dazzled the eye. And the imagination was bewildered at their charms, for
                        indeed each of them was brighter than the sun and the moon. Before them they lighted brilliant
                        flambeaux of wax in candelabra of gold, but their faces outshone the flambeaux, for that they
                        had eyes sharper than unsheathed swords and the lashes of their eyelids bewitched all hearts.
                        Their cheeks were rosy red and their necks and shapes gracefully swayed and their eyes wantoned
                        like the gazelle's. And the slave girls came to meet them with instruments of music. Then the
                        two Kings entered the hammam bath, and when they came forth, they sat down on a couch set with
                        pearls and gems, whereupon the two sisters came up to them and stood between their hands, as
                        they were moons, bending and leaning from side to side in their beauty and loveliness.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently they brought forward Scheherazade and displayed
                        her, for the first dress, in a red suit, whereupon King Shahryar rose to look upon her and the
                        wits of all present, men and women, were bewitched for that she was even as saith of her one of
                        her describers:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sun on wand in knoll of sand she
                        showed,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad in her cramoisy-hued
                        chemisette.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her lips' honeydew she gave me
                        drink<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with her rosy cheeks quencht fire she set.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Then they attired Dunyazade in a dress of blue brocade and she became
                        as she were the full moon when it shineth forth. So they displayed her in this, for the first
                        dress, before King Shah Zaman, who rejoiced in her and well-nigh swooned away for love longing
                        and amorous desire. Yea, he was distraught with passion for her whenas he saw her, because she
                        was as saith of her one of her describers in these couplets:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes appareled in an azure
                        vest,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultramarine as skies are deckt and
                        dight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I view'd th' unparalleled sight, which showed my
                        eyes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summer moon upon a winter night.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they returned to Scheherazade and displayed her in the
                        second dress, a suit of surpassing goodliness, and veiled her face with her hair like a chin
                        veil. Moreover, they let down her side locks, and she was even as saith of her one of her
                        describers in these couplets:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O hail to him whose locks his cheeks
                        o'ershade,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who slew my life by cruel hard
                        despite.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said I, "Hast veiled the morn in night?" He
                        said,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay I but veil moon in hue of night."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Then they displayed Dunyazade in a second and a third and a fourth
                        dress, and she paced forward like the rising sun, and swayed to and fro in the insolence of
                        beauty, and she was even as saith the poet of her in these couplets:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun of beauty she to all
                        appears<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lovely coy, she mocks all
                        loveliness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he fronts her favor and her
                        smile<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-morn, the sun of day in clouds must dress.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Then they displayed Scheherazade in the third dress and the fourth and
                        the fifth, and she became as she were a ban branch snell or a thirsting gazelle, lovely of face
                        and perfect in attributes of grace, even as saith of her one in these couplets:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes like fullest moon on happy
                        night,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taper of waist with shape of magic
                        might.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hath an eye whose glances quell
                        mankind,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ruby on her cheeks reflects his
                        light.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enveils her hips the blackness of her
                        hair-<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware of curls that bite with viper
                        bite!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sides are silken-soft, that while the
                        heart<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere rock behind that surface 'scapes our
                        sight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fringed curtains of her eyne she
                        shoots<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shafts that at furthest range on mark alight.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they returned to Dunyazade and displayed her in the
                        fifth dress and in the sixth, which was green, when she surpassed with her loveliness the fair
                        of the four quarters of the world, and outvied with the brightness of her countenance the full
                        moon at rising tide, for she was even as saith of her the poet in these couplets:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;A damsel 'twas the tirer's art had decked with snare and
                        sleight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And robed with rays as though the sun from her had borrowed
                        light.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;She came before us wondrous clad in chemisette of green,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As
                        veiled by his leafy screen Pomegranate hides from sight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he said, "How
                        callest thou the fashion of thy dress?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;She answered us in pleasant way with
                        double meaning dight:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We call this garment crevecoeur, and rightly is it
                        hight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For many a heart wi' this we brake and harried many a sprite."</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Then they displayed Scheherazade in the sixth and seventh dresses and
                        clad her in youth's clothing, whereupon she came forward swaying from side to side and
                        coquettishly moving, and indeed she ravished wits and hearts and ensorceled all eyes with her
                        glances. She shook her sides and swayed her haunches, then put her hair on sword hilt and went
                        up to King Shahryar, who embraced her as hospitable host embraceth guest, and threatened her in
                        her ear with the taking of the sword, and she was even as saith of her the poet in these words:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not the murk of gender
                        male,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than feminines surpassing
                        fair,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirewomen they had grudged the
                        bride,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who made her beard and whiskers wear!</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Thus also they did with her sister Dunyazade, and when they had made an
                        end of the display, the King bestowed robes of honor on all who were present and sent the brides
                        to their own apartments. Then Scheherazade went in to King Shahryar and Dunyazade to King, Shah
                        Zaman, and each of them solaced himself with the company of his beloved consort and the hearts
                        of the folk were comforted.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;When morning morrowed, the Wazir came in to the two Kings
                        and kissed ground before them, wherefore they thanked him and were large of bounty to him.
                        Presently they went forth and sat down upon couches of kingship, whilst all the wazirs and emirs
                        and grandees and lords of the land presented themselves and kissed ground. King Shahryar ordered
                        them dresses of honor and largess, and they prayed for the permanence and prosperity of the King
                        and his brother.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the two sovereigns appointed their sire-in-law, the
                        Wazir, to be Viceroy in Samarkand, and assigned him five of the chief emirs to accompany him,
                        charging them attend him and do him service. The Minister kissed the ground and prayed that they
                        might be vouchsafed length of life. Then he went in to his daughters, whilst the eunuchs and
                        ushers walked before him, and saluted them and farewelled them. They kissed his hands and gave
                        him joy of the kingship and bestowed on him immense treasures, after which he took leave of them
                        and setting out, fared days and nights till he came near Samarkand, where the townspeople met
                        him at a distance of three marches and rejoiced in him with exceeding joy. So he entered the
                        city and they decorated the houses, and it was a notable day. He sat down on the throne of his
                        kingship and the wazirs did him homage and the grandees and emirs of Samarkand, and all prayed
                        that he might be vouchsafed justice and victory and length of continuance. So he bestowed on
                        them robes of honor and entreated them with distinction, and they made him Sultan over them.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as his father-in-law had departed for Samarkand,
                        King Shahryar summoned the grandees of his realm and made them a stupendous banquet of all
                        manner of delicious meats and exquisite sweetmeats. He also bestowed on them robes of honor and
                        guerdoned them, and divided the kingdoms between himself and his brother in their presence,
                        whereat the folk rejoiced. Then the two Kings abode, each ruling a day in turn, and they were
                        ever in harmony each with other, while on similar wise their wives continued in the love of
                        Allah Almighty and in thanksgiving to Him. And the peoples and the provinces were at peace and
                        the preachers prayed for them from the pulpits, and their report was bruited abroad and the
                        travelers bore tidings of them to all lands.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;In due time King Shahryar summoned chroniclers and copyists
                        and bade them write all that had betided him with his wife, first and last. So they wrote this
                        and named it The Stories of the Thousand Nights and a Night. The book came to thirty volumes,
                        and these the King laid up in his treasury. And the two brothers abode with their wives in all
                        pleasaunce and solace of life and its delights, for that indeed Allah the Most High had chanced
                        their annoy into joy, and on this wise they continued till there took them the Destroyer of
                        delights and the Severer of societies, the Desolator of dwelling places and Gamerer of
                        graveyards, and they were translated to the ruth of Almighty Allah. Their houses fell waste and
                        their palaces lay in ruins and the kings inherited their riches.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there reigned after them a wise ruler, who was just,
                        keen-witted, and accomplished, and loved tales and legends, especially those which chronicle the
                        doings of sovereigns and sultans, and he found in the treasury these marvelous stories and
                        wondrous histories, contained in the thirty volumes aforesaid. So he read in them a first book
                        and a second and a third and so on to the last of them, and each book astounded and delighted
                        him more than that which preceded it, till he came to the end of them. Then he admired whatso he
                        had read therein of description and discourse and rare traits and anecdotes and moral instances
                        and reminiscences, and bade the folk copy them and dispread them over all lands and climes,
                        wherefore their report was bruited abroad and the people named them The Marvels and Wonders of
                        the Thousand Nights and a Night. This is all that hath come down to us of the origin of this
                        book, and Allah is All-knowing. So Glory he to Him Whom the shifts of Time waste not away, nor
                        doth aught of chance or change affect His sway, Whom one case diverteth not from other case and
                        Who is sole in the attributes of perfect grace. And prayer and peace he upon the Lord's Pontiff
                        and Chosen One among His creatures, our lord MOHAMMED, the Prince of mankind, through whom we
                        supplicate Him for a goodly and a godly.</p>
