<h1>Netiquette</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is Netiquette?</strong> It's network etiquette, a set of rules for behaving properly online. Cyberspace has its own culture, and it's easy to forget that in cyberspace we are dealing with real people, not just bits and bytes.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 1: Remember the Human.</strong> The computer screen cannot convey facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice, and the person you are communicating with is an actual person. Behave respectfully, and resist the temptation to treat conversations as interactions with faceless strangers. They are real people.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 2: Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.</strong> In other words, don't download pirated content on the internet if you wouldn't steal an actual movie in real life.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Rule 3: Know where you are in cyberspace.</strong> Know the norms and behaviors of the group you are communicating with. For example, when texting, abbreviations and emojis are acceptable, but in some discussion groups, whole words and sentences are preferred.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Rule 4:&nbsp; Respect other people's time and bandwidth.</strong> "Bandwidth" is the information-carrying capacity of the wires and channels that connect everyone is cyberspace. When we think about time and bandwidth, we consider, "Is this message really something the recipient needs to know?"&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Rule 5: Make yourself look good online.</strong> People online won't judge you by your looks or clothes or skin color, but they will judge you by the quality of your writing. Use good spelling and grammar. Know what you are talking about, and stick to the facts. Finally, be pleasant and polite, don't use offensive language, and don't be confrontational for the sake of confrontation.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 6: Share expert knowledge.</strong> You have something to offer to conversations. Don't be afraid to share what you know. This is how the sum total of world knowledge increases, and it's one of the reasons the internet was invented: to share information.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 7: Help keep flame wars under control.</strong> "Flaming" is what people do when they express a strongly held opinion without holding back any emotion. Netiquette doesn't prohibit flaming or flame wars -- sometimes ideas need the heat -- but letting them go on too long or happen too often is a waste of people's time and bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 8: Respect other people's privacy.</strong> There may be times when you stumble upon an unattended email account, social media account, or chat window. Resist the urge to snoop. It's bad Netiquette.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 9: Don't abuse your power.</strong> Similar to respecting other people's privacy, there may be times when you have more power online than others do. Don't use that cyber-authority to snoop on others' private information and messages.</li>
<li><strong>Rule 10: Be forgiving of other people's mistakes.</strong> Everyone is a newbie in some area. Be kind when you see a spelling error or a question that's been asked multitudes of times. Don't feel like you have to point out others' mistakes. If you do decide to inform someone of a mistake, point it out politely, and preferably by private email rather than in public.&nbsp;</li>
