<h2>Introductions!</h2>
<p>[Before posting, please review the directions on the Discussion Boards page under Introduction Discussion.]</p>
<p>Please introduce yourself. Here are some questions to get you started:</p>
<p>What is your name?</p>
<p>What is your area of study and what career are you pursuing?</p>
<p>What would you like the class to know about you?</p>
<p>What is something you would recommend the rest of the class try -  a favorite book, hobby, restaurant, television show, film, band, thing to do in Nashville, or other advice?</p>

<h2>Ice Breaker Discussion</h2>
<p class="meta-note"><em>Includes assessment.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the semester, teachers tend to get questions or comments that sound like this:</p>
<p>"What can I do about my grade?" "I just need one more chance" "</p>
<p>"This will hurt my GPA!" "Why can't I have more time?"</p>
<p>I'm not saying you will think this way. In fact, one of the goals of this course is to help prevent this "end of semester panic." Writing is a process. To do well, you will need to engage in the writing process. It does not start with perfection. Writing, like all skills, needs to be practiced to gain strength and proficiency in it. In this Ice Breaker discussion, please engage this idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>) In your first paragraph, answer this question:</li>
</ol>
<p>What can I, as an instructor, do to help you engage in the course material?</p>
<p>Please be honest. This is an exercise to see what tools you need for your course success. Also, please take this seriously. We can't have "automatic A's" or "unlimited time." These, while also impossible, would take away from your engagement in the course and the skills learned. However, instructors can benefit from honesty. What would help you to do better in the course? This is another form of the question you may answer too.</p>
<ol>
<li>) For your second paragraph, please answer this question:</li>
</ol>
<p>What will you have to do, as a student, to engage the course material and earn the grade you want?</p>
<p>See, we both get to answer this question. Again, please be honest. Many soft skills can help you in this and all courses. For example:</p>
<p>Ask Questions: By asking questions, you will be engaging in the material. There are no bad questions.</p>
<p>Punctuality: Get your assignments completed and turned in when due.</p>
<p>Read the Learning Materials: To do well, you will have to read the textbook and other Learning Materials.</p>
<p>You can't get away from writing: In a writing course, you must write. However, you may find that you enjoy writing about some topics more than others. That's a good thing!</p>
<p>Plan ahead: Will you be away from the course for a bit? Work ahead. This is possible. Planning will help in the long run.</p>
<p>These are just some examples. Just answer the question honestly. This is what I call pre-brainstorming. You're already engaging in the writing process.</p>
<ol>
<li>) Please respond to other students, as our discussion rubric gives more points for responses. What do you think about their ways of engaging the material? Do they have some good tips or plans that may help you succeed? Do you share similar goals? Give them some feedback. Feedback is another part of the writing process.</li>
</ol>
