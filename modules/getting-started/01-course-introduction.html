<h1>Course Introduction and Expectations</h1>
This course focuses on ancient literature, beginning with <i>Gilgamesh</i>, the first story recorded in 2100 BCE, up to the translation of <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i> in 1706 CE; However, it is important to note that the textbook is not organized in chronological order. In our book, there are three chapters and three major modules for the course. Each chapter is organized by a particular topic, explained in the chapter introductions and discussions. Each reading in this course was picked to provide a wide range of cultures, narrative styles, and belief systems and frame each of those stories in historical and contemporary contexts. This course is designed to facilitate a deeper understanding of each of these texts individually and in global terms.</div>

<div><br>The purpose of this course is to help the student engage in the study of literature and map the contours of what it means to be human—our aspirations and anxieties, our histories and hopes—that is essential to understanding the literature of diverse cultures, and to be able to write about, critique, and frame the texts. Each student is expected to actively contribute as an individual using online resources, including communication, discussions, time management, and project management skills.</div>

<div><br>A large portion of the course is designed for students to research and explore the historical context literary importance of ancient literature and facilitate the students’ exploration of the relativity of ancient literature through discussions, formative assessment, and written work. Chapter discussions and activities are meant to enhance the student’s knowledge and relate content to add diverse perspectives. All smaller assignments within the course, e.g., discussions, quizzes, short answers, are used to build and create the more significant assignments, e.g., the Literary Analysis. There are no predetermined class meeting times, but you are expected to communicate with your instructor and peers as needed. Weekly assignments are typically posted on Monday, discussion submissions are due by Thursday, and assignments and discussion responses are due on Monday. The Anthology Project and Literary Analysis assignments are designed to be completed over a series of weeks. Still, they have associated deadlines listed in the schedule, as well as an infographic timeline for when each step should be completed.&nbsp;<br><br></div>

<div><br>We have quite a few ways to get to know one another this semester. Every week, I will read, respond to, and provide written feedback on your work, such as discussions. Every assignment has a rubric, which you can view anytime, which also functions as a form of evaluative feedback from me. Outside of assignments, you can email me within NS Online email or any other email using the email provided in the syllabus. You can also text me within reasonable hours and schedule office hours or a zoom session using my office hours QR code, which is also in the syllabus. &nbsp;</div>
