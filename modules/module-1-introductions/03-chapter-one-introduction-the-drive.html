            <article class="prose">
                <p><span class="drop-cap">E</span>rnest Becker is an author and philosopher who explores the modern
                    person who is subsisting, in Western modernity, living in a complete and total abundance culture,
                    yet starving at an existential level.</p>

                <p>This could mean starving for a real sense of recognition in this world of digital ontologies,
                    starving for identity, starving for a system of meaning that will endure throughout their otherwise
                    daily conjugal visits with suffering. Given the circumstances, there is also a deep irony to having
                    these problems: we are overpopulated and yet often feel alone. We have a million paths to follow in
                    life and often feel completely lost. However, why do we care about creating a system of meaning in
                    the first place? Where does the desire for purpose even come from? Our internal experience is not
                    like other animals, where they don’t seem to sit around and agonize over whether their life has
                    meaning.</p>

                <p>On the symbolic side of our existence, in our heads somewhere, we can do incredible things: we create
                    societies, we write symphonies, we see billions of light-years away, we make Gods, and we can
                    contemplate the infinite. The tension, according to Becker, lies in the fact that we are capable of
                    all these fantastic things, and then at the same time, on the biological side of our existence, we
                    are incredibly fragile. If we take one wrong step off a curb, we may get flattened by a bus. Or we
                    may get some unexpected illness nobody’s ever heard of. Becker is saying that there are so many ways
                    to die, and it doesn’t matter if we have painted the most outstanding picture of all time and
                    touched the lives of billions; we are always just one step away from someone having to go into your
                    Wikipedia page and turn “is” into “was.”</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    "Terror is induced by realizing that we are limited animals with unlimited horizons." —
                    <strong>Ernest Becker</strong>
                </div>

                <p>Becker’s main point here is that human beings cannot function in the world while also being aware of
                    their death constantly haunting their minds. It would be too painful. Once we become aware of our
                    mortality, if we do not do something about it, we will be living in a constant state of dread.
                    Philosophers describe this feeling in several different ways: they may call it an ambiguity, they
                    may call it nausea, some call it an existential paradox, but regardless of what language we use to
                    describe it, Becker is going to call this place being in a state of terror.</p>

                <h3>Heroic Systems</h3>
                <p>Ernest Becker’s “heroic systems,” found in <em>The Denial of Death</em>, is our first supplementary
                    concept and is meant to set the tone for this module. We will be looking at the texts in this
                    module: <em>Works and Days</em>, <em>Popol Vuh</em>, <em>Gilgamesh</em>, <em>The Inferno</em>, and
                    <em>Don Quixote</em> through the lens of Becker’s ideas.
                </p>

                <p>The question is simple: what drives us to do the things we do, and why do we create the systems of
                    meaning that we have?</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>The Core Question</strong>
                    <p>Do we just accept social programming “unthinkingly” and “uncritically” as Becker suggests, and,
                        if not, are those systems of heroics worth our devotion?</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Breakdown</h3>
                <p>Humans, in some ways, are like all other creatures; we share a basic biological predisposition
                    towards self-preservation and the interests of survival and reproduction. What makes us unique is
                    that we have got an enormous forebrain. This allows us to do many things, including thinking in
                    abstract and symbolic terms to the point where we can create “things” that do not exist (physically)
                    or use our imagination to conceptualize something brand new and create them.</p>

                <p>We are also able to position ourselves in time. We can think about things that had happened in the
                    past, even before we ever existed. We can think about things that might happen in the very distant
                    future. We can imagine ourselves in an infinite number of potential or possible scenarios. However,
                    if we realize that we will someday die, that anyone can die at any time, for reasons that no one
                    could ever anticipate or control, most of us would not be able to get up in the morning if that is
                    all we thought about.</p>

                <p>What our ancestors did rather ingeniously, albeit quite unconsciously, is to solve the problem of how
                    to manage the existential terror that is gendered by the awareness of death, which is, in turn, a
                    byproduct of our intelligence. Through the narrative of human-constructed beliefs about the nature
                    of reality that we share with other people, culture hides or minimizes the anxiety of death by
                    assigning value and meaning to our lives.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>All cultures provide an account of the origin of the universe.</li>
                    <li>All cultures have prescriptions for how we should behave while we are here.</li>
                    <li>All cultures have some hope of immortality either literally through heaven’s souls’
                        reincarnations or afterlives of the world's great religions.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, people may realize that they will not be here forever, but they are still
                        comforted by the possibility that a vestige of their existence will persist over time, perhaps
                        by:
                        <ul>
                            <li>having children</li>
                            <li>amassing great fortunes up</li>
                            <li>writing great books or maybe producing great works of art or scientific discoveries.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Mortality Salience Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>Becker outlines two major components to our Heroic systems. The first component in terror management
                    theory, formalized by psychologists Jeff Greenberg, Sheldon Solomon, and Tom Pyszczynski, building
                    on Becker's ideas, is that individuals need to sustain faith in a meaningful worldview. The second
                    component intones that individuals need to feel as though they are valued, protected members or
                    objects of significance within this worldview. People would generally call this self-esteem.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>Contemporary Example: The Judges Study</strong>
                    <p>In a study with Municipal Court judges in Tucson, Arizona, judges have a clear set of values that
                        are part of their world, and that is to uphold the law. So, what if we make some judges think
                        about their death?</p>
                    <p>According to the “Mortality Salience Hypothesis,” they should become more punitive toward a
                        lawbreaker.</p>
                    <p>The study found that the judges who are reminded of their death before setting a bond for a
                        prostitute recommended a bond of <strong>$455</strong>; control judges, who were not reminded of
                        their death, set up an average bond of <strong>$50</strong>.</p>
                </div>

                <p>We do not think about this all that much. Consciously, in our daily lives, most psychological
                    activity is entirely unconscious. We repress our concerns and thoughts about death, but it is
                    underneath. It is outside of consciousness. For example, when people are reminded of their
                    mortality... they change their behavior to resist this awareness by doubling down on their heroic
                    system.</p>

                <p>Christians, for example, become more derogatory towards Jewish people and become more hostile towards
                    Muslims. Germans sit further away from Turkish people. Americans reminded of death become more
                    physically aggressive to other Americans that do not share their political beliefs. Iranians
                    reminded of death are more supportive of suicide bombing.</p>

                <h3>Materialism & Nature</h3>
                <p>The human fear of death also contributes to our often hostile view of nature. After all, everything
                    in nature is of finite duration and will eventually decay and die. Laboratory studies confirm that
                    intimations of mortality increase our contempt for and disregard of nature.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    "Ritual is a preindustrial technique of manufacture."
                </div>

                <p>To state this concept with brevity: when we became self-aware, we became aware of the end, which led
                    us to feel a profound sense of insignificance. This led to the crippling anxiety that we had to
                    counter by creating culture: activities and beliefs that would give us the illusion that we are
                    persons of value in an engineered world of meaning.</p>

                <p>The central property of these human sources of self-esteem is that they constitute a narrowing of
                    focus strategies. Like sainthood or being the greatest knight, It is hero-worshipping and
                    hero-worship can be romantic, political, martial, or even fandom, looking at you Firefly fans.
                    Ernest Becker calls all of these examples fetishes, or our particular heroic system on which we
                    become fixated.</p>

                <h3>The Problem of Progress</h3>
                <p>Furthermore, the idea that history is cyclic can render any progress obtained meaningless because, if
                    it is cyclical, then there is only moral gain and loss. Indeed, the idea of moral progress,
                    believing that we have come a long way despite our destruction of other species, imbues the course
                    of history with meaning.</p>

                <p>All the marvels of modern technology might have only served to provide increased longevity and
                    material resources to a few overpopulated generations of humans at the expense of perhaps hundreds
                    of thousands of billions of humans in the future. The attempt to achieve symbolic immortality
                    through progress will have produced the opposite effect – a vast increase in mortality, perhaps
                    leading to the extinction of the human species.</p>
