<h1>Introduction to the Text</h1>
<p>Welcome to the text for Early World Literature. </p>
<p>This is an Open Education text, and the book and reading use a survey approach. </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>We have selected texts from many different periods and cultures. We have also endeavored to include literature from as many diverse cultures as possible to give a truly global perspective.</p>
<p>When it comes to analyzing these texts, however, one of the significant differences between experts and novices <em>in any domain</em> is the ability to distinguish what is critical from what is unimportant or irrelevant. Since experts quickly recognize the most critical features in any one piece of information, they allocate their time efficiently, quickly identifying what is valuable and finding the right “hooks” with which to incorporate the most valuable information into existing knowledge. We are not experts, yet though. With that in mind, <strong>this text also</strong><strong> </strong><strong>attempts</strong><strong> to </strong><strong>provide</strong><strong> relevant</strong><strong> explicit cues or prompts</strong> that assist us in attending to those features that matter most.</p>
<p>Thus, before we jump into the course and the literature for this semester, it would benefit us to spend some time exploring the purpose and logic of the course, the way it is constructed, and what you are meant to get out of it:</p>
<p>First, this course is divided into three chapters: </p>
<p>The Drive, </p>
<p>The Warrior, and</p>
<p>The Woman. </p>
<p>Each story included in these sections has been collated together because they share a similar <strong>deep structure</strong> or<strong> underlying meaning</strong>. </p>
<p>These specific texts were chosen to provide a diverse, equitable look at Ancient to Early literature; however, they were also chosen because of the deep, underlying structure of each text <strong>as it</strong><strong> is concerned with concepts, questions, or issues that are still relevant to our lives now</strong>.</p>
<p>To provide some of those “expert cues,” the text also frames each chapter with a <strong>supplementary concept</strong><strong>, </strong>giving a frame of reference to the story that is relevant ways to our lives now. Many of the texts we will explore are from times, locations, and perspectives (ancient), that will be very, very foreign to many of us. </p>
<p>Due to this fact, this course is a bit different from other literature surveys in the following ways: </p>
<p>The number of readings has been reduced to be more digestible (hurrah).</p>
<p>We spend more time with each work (only one per week, usually) to explore it in more depth and create meaningful connections to the text.</p>
<p>Supplementary concepts are provided to give a <em>lens through which to analyze the literature.</em></p>
<p>Each module is designed to create a relationship that makes at least one of the texts relevant to you, us, or society at large, <em>here and now.</em></p>
<p>Many students may feel a little anxious coming into a course on writing, especially if they have had a poor experience in schools or classes. At its core, though, English is about a thing we all want to do: express ourselves and be understood. </p>
<p>With that in mind, let me clear up one central myth; there is no such thing as a person who is born a “writer” or an “English” person. Success in this class is determined by your engagement with the literature, concepts, and our Early World Literature community. The more we work together and push each other, the better our work will be. I hope you enjoy this text and can connect with these pieces of ancient literature in a meaningful way.</p>
