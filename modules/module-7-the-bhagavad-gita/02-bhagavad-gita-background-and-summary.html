<p>The <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, “The Song of the Lord,” is one of the most revered devotional texts in Hinduism. This text is part of a larger epic, the <em>Mahabharata</em>, an ancient story that likely took literary form between the 5th century BCE and the 2nd century BCE. The Gita addresses <strong>dharma</strong>, a concept that represents the cosmic law, duty, and righteousness. Arjuna, the protagonist, faces a moral crisis about his role in a civil war and engages in a dialogue with Krishna, his charioteer, who reveals profound spiritual truths about duty, action, and renunciation. The Gita’s key themes include knowledge, action, and love.</p>
<p>Though composed long ago, the Gita addresses timeless human dilemmas. Northern India was experiencing political upheaval around the time of its composition, possibly coinciding with the decline of the Mauryan Empire. The Gita reflects the challenges faced by individuals during times of civil strife, as Arjuna’s moral crisis about fighting his own family mirrors real-world dilemmas of its ancient audience.</p>
<p>The Gita has significantly influenced Hindu philosophy and has also resonated with other spiritual traditions, including some interpretations within Buddhism. One of its most important readers was Mahatma Gandhi. For Gandhi, the text was not just to be read but lived: “I have [made] an effort to enforce the meaning of the Gita in my own conduct [for] forty years... It is a misuse of our intellectual energy and a waste of time to go on reading what we cannot put into practice.”</p>
<p>This may seem surprising, as the Gita teaches that war and violence are acceptable in the service of <strong>dharma</strong>, while Gandhi completely renounced violence of any kind, even for the noblest causes. Krishna teaches in the text that one can fight a real war without sin if done in support of dharma, one’s sacred duty to maintain the cosmic order. Gandhi believed that Krishna's teachings on “killing” were metaphorical, encouraging people to destroy negative thoughts and impulses, which may feel as familiar as family. Gandhi used this interpretation to inspire India’s independence movement, emphasizing non-violent protest, or <em>ahimsa</em>.</p>
<p>To get the most from the text, it’s important to understand what each character represents:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arjuna</strong>: Represents humanity, embodying all our doubts, worries, and habits.</li>
<li><strong>Krishna</strong>: Symbolizes the “higher Self” or the divine.</li>
<li><strong>The Pandavas</strong>: Represent the great virtues within us.</li>
<li><strong>The Kauravas</strong>: Represent opposing forces within us.</li>
<li><strong>The Chariot</strong>: Symbolizes our physical body.</li>
<li><strong>The Horses</strong>: Represent our five senses, which must be guided by the self in order for us to realize our true nature.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p>Five thousand years ago (according to Hindu tradition), in ancient India, royal lineages came into conflict over who should ascend to the throne. Two sets of cousins—the Pandavas, consisting of five noble brothers, and the Kauravas, the hundred sons of a blind regent—could not agree on a peaceful successor. As a result, both factions go to war, with battle lines drawn and armies mustered. The Pandavas, however, have special help in the form of the god Krishna, who serves as Arjuna’s charioteer.</p>
<p>The battlefield is a fearsome sight. Drums beat, conch shells blare, and lords and kings shout orders. Elephants adorned in gold trumpet amidst gleaming chariots. Armor glittering with embedded gems blazes like fire, and a rainbow of battle standards fills the field. But as the two mighty forces stand ready for war, Prince Arjuna falters. When he looks out at the two armies, he does not see foot soldiers, archers, and charioteers, but fathers, grandfathers, teachers, sons, and friends.</p>
<p>Arjuna is not alone on the battlefield. Alongside him, disguised in mortal form, stands Krishna. Arjuna tells Krishna that when he sees his family ready for war, his knees go weak, and he cannot stop shaking. He faces a profound moral conflict, unsure of how killing his family could lead to any good. He drops his weapons and weeps, but Krishna, understanding Arjuna’s struggle, cannot help but smile.</p>
<p>Krishna has come to guide Arjuna to a higher path, and he begins to explain the eternal nature of the soul. According to Krishna, the soul never dies—it merely changes bodies, just as we change clothes. Therefore, Arjuna should not worry about killing his family, as their true essence cannot be killed.</p>
<p>Seeing that this wisdom calms Arjuna, Krishna continues to reveal deeper truths about the universe. He explains that sacrifices made for material pleasures are misguided. The ultimate spiritual pursuit, Krishna says, is to detach oneself from material things and dedicate oneself to one’s <strong>dharma</strong>, or duty. For Arjuna, as a warrior, his dharma is to fight for what is right.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by these revelations, Arjuna asks Krishna how he can be expected to act if true enlightenment requires detachment from worldly desires. Krishna explains that Arjuna must not act for personal gain, but for the welfare of the world. Desire clouds judgment, but by acting selflessly, Arjuna can fulfill his role in the universe without being tainted by attachment. Krishna then reveals that he is incarnated on Earth for a reason: whenever there is imbalance in the universe, he manifests to restore cosmic order.</p>
<p>Realizing that Krishna is more than a mere charioteer, Arjuna asks to see Krishna’s true form. Krishna reveals himself in his divine, cosmic form, with infinite mouths, eyes, and limbs. Arjuna sees entire armies rushing into Krishna’s many fanged mouths to die, symbolizing that the outcome of the battle is already determined.</p>
<p>Krishna tells Arjuna that the battle is already won—Arjuna must simply act according to his dharma. Arjuna, now filled with divine insight, bows to Krishna and swears his loyalty. Krishna, returning to his human form, gently reminds Arjuna that while he is bound to fight, the choice is ultimately his.</p>
<p>With this newfound wisdom, Arjuna’s fear dissipates. He understands that life and death are inevitable, and trusting in Krishna, he prepares to fight. Arjuna squares his shoulders, takes a deep breath, and looks deep inside himself. With clarity about his role as a warrior and his duty to the universe, Arjuna leads his troops into battle with newfound resolve.</p>
