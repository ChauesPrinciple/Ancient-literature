<div class="image-placeholder" style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;"><em>[Image Intended: A Picture of a Historical Edition of the Gita]</em></div>
<p>There are three major themes that the Bhagavad Gita illuminates: knowledge (jnana), action (karma), and love (bhakti):</p>
<p>Knowledge: Krishna shows Arjuna that his grief is misplaced since the eternal soul, unlike the body, cannot be slain.</p>
<p>Krishna urges Arjuna to acquire discriminative wisdom (i.e., the ability to distinguish the eternal from the transient).</p>
<p>One acquires this wisdom by cultivating steadiness of mind, which Krishna compares to a lamp unflickering in a windless place.</p>
<p>Attainment of the mental stability requires practice, especially yoga postures (“stopping the whirlpools of the mind”), which help to concentrate the mind. The body is a vehicle for helping the mind come to repose.</p>
<p>Action: Acting without getting enmeshed in the results of action.</p>
<p>Krishna asks Arjuna to renounce not the worldly life or action itself, but instead the fruits of action. One must bring steadiness of mind into action: yoga is “skill in action.”</p>
<p>The four purushartas or goals of life are kama (please or passion), artha (wealth or power), dharma, and moksha (freedom).</p>
<p>On the field of dharma, one should act without passion (nishkama) and without desire for the fruits of action (nishphalaratha). Through yoga, one can cultivate a disinterestedness in or detachment from the outcome of action.</p>
<p>Love: Dedicate your action in devotion to God.</p>
<p>God – Bhagavan – is the supreme reality that is both ultimate and personal.</p>
<p>Krishna teaches a lesson of divine presence: “Though I am unborn, I come into being in age after age, whenever dharma declines and adharma is on the rise” (Bhagavad Gita 4). This is the first articulation of divine descent or avatara.</p>
<p>At Arjuna’s request, Krishna reveals his supreme form, which Arjuna perceives with a special third eye.</p>
<p>Arjuna responds with love to Krishna’s revelation. Only through love can one perceive Krishna’s true form.</p>
<p>Krishna reveals his love for Arjuna, saying: “Abandoning all dharma, come to me alone for refuge…”</p>
<p>Love can subvert dharma; there is no need to consider dharma when one consecrates one’s acts to God.</p>
<p>Arjuna is worried about entering the battle and destroying his own family, so Krishna begins by explaining five reasons why Arjuna should not be troubled by this. Essentially Krishna shows Arjuna why he will not get bad karma from taking part in the war.</p>
<p>The first reason Krishna mentions is that because atman (the Self) is eternal, it is a mistake to think that one can kill someone. What happens is that people are sent to the next stage of reincarnation.“[Krishna speaking] One believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain. Both are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. You were never born; you will never die. You have never changed; you can never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, you do not die when the body dies.” (Bhagavad Gita 2:19-20)</p>
<p>The second reason why Arjuna should fight is because of honor and duty. (The root of the word dharma, commonly translated as “duty,” is from the Sanskrit root dhr – meaning “what holds things up or sustains. Dharma, here refers to the way in which aligning one’s decisions to dharma duty hold together the proper order of things, and this is why Krishna the sustainer, is the manifestation appearing now to Arjuna.) Arjuna is a member of the warrior class; the battle is the very reason for his existence within this particular order now.</p>
<p>The third reason Krishna gives is that inaction is impossible. Withdrawing from battle is in itself a conscious decision; not choosing is still a choice. This is, in a way, a criticism of some worldviews, such as asceticism, which claim that leaving everything behind is inaction. Withdrawing from society is always a deliberate act.</p>
<p>The fourth reason given by Krishna is that the source of evil is not in actions but in passion and desires, the intentions behind the actions. This brings the dialogue to the last reason.</p>
<p>The fifth and last reason is that there are ways to act where we can do what we have to do without getting bad karma.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains three ways to act without getting bad karma.</p>
<p>The first way is Jnana yoga (the way of knowledge). This idea is based on the Upanishads and holds that life and death are not real. Selfhood is nothing but an illusion. All we see are manifestations of the one. Once we realize that the one is behind all things, we can escape the bad karma from acting: “[Krishna speaking] I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me.” (Bhagavad Gita 6:30)</p>
<p>The second way is Bhakti yoga (the way of devotion). This is an idea developed in great detail in Hinduism and holds that our actions can be dedicated to Krishna by surrendering our will to him, and he will take upon himself any bad karma.</p>
<p>The third way is Karma yoga (“the way of action” or “the way of works”). The idea behind Karma yoga is acting without attachment; in other words, to act without being so concerned about the outcome of our actions. According to this view, if we act in such a way as not to get attached to the fruits of our actions, we can be more effective. Sometimes emotions like fear, embarrassment, or anxiety can interfere with the outcome of what we do.</p>
<p>It is essential when we approach the Gita to understand that it is not literal. The battlefield is not the actual battlefield but the battlefield that exists in our minds. However, the concepts Krishna touches on should be taken seriously, and whether to kill or not is at the core of Arjuna's struggle. Like our subsequent text, Beowulf, this text is a guide for proper action. Beowulf will explore what it means to be a good, generous king in an Anglo-Saxon culture that centers around "guilt and fairness" while the Gita examines what it means to be a warrior within an honor-centered culture, like the Iliad.</p>
<p>Dharma, in a non-religious sense, can also be understood as a duty on a grander scale. We have explored the implications of what it means to live and function within a zero-sum honor culture and, viscerally, how inaction is impossible through Elijah Wood's Code of the Streets. Here, however, I would like to take a different focus: when is it wrong to kill, and why does Krishna push Arjuna towards the annihilation of his own family? Let us look at these lines from Chapter II:</p>
<p>…but wrongful deem</p>
<p>The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol</p>
<p>The letter of their Vedas, saying, "This</p>
<p>Is all we have, or need;" being weak at heart</p>
<p>With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes--they say--</p>
<p>As "fruit of good deeds done;" promising men</p>
<p>Much profit in new births for works of faith;</p>
<p>In various rites abounding; following whereon</p>
<p>Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Look! like as when a tank pours water forth</p>
<p>To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw</p>
<p>Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.</p>
<p>But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward</p>
<p>Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be</p>
<p>Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.</p>
<p>And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts</p>
<p>Thy piety, casting all self aside,</p>
<p>Contemning gain and merit; equable</p>
<p>In good or evil: equability</p>
<p>Is Yog, is piety!</p>
<p>Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results. Here Krishna informs Arjuna that we have the right to do our duty, but the results are not dependent only upon our efforts. Several factors come into play in determining the results according to Krishna—our efforts, destiny (our past karmas), the will of God, the efforts of others, the cumulative karmas of the people involved, the place, and situation (a matter of luck). If we become anxious for results, we will experience anxiety whenever they are not according to our expectations. So, Shree Krishna advises Arjun to give up concern for the results and instead focus solely on doing a good job. The fact is that when we are unconcerned about the results, we can focus entirely on our efforts, and the result is even better than before.</p>
<p>Similarly, the fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. To perform actions is an integral part of human nature. While performing these actions, we must remember that we are not the enjoyers of the results. Thus, a primary determiner of what is right or moral is intent rather than the result. How does this apply to war and death? Please keep this in mind for context with one of our later texts, Song of Roland, where the epic's entire purpose is to destroy an idea: someone else's faith.</p>
<p>Here Krishna is outlining why and how it is wrong to desire to kill an idea.</p>
<p>We often mistake our distaste for emotion or an idea as a dislike of the person and for killing the body. For example, if someone makes us feel angry, we may think to ourselves, "I want to kill this person." However, the thing we want to "kill" is that angry thought within our heads. We wish to eliminate the thought that vibrates within the person's head, not necessarily the person we may end up killing. If we are part of a party, like a political party, for example, and then someone stands against the party's ideals, the consensus may be to kill that person. However, we could not stop with one, could we? Since it is the idea we wish to kill, it would require killing every person who had that idea.</p>
<p>Beowulf</p>
<div class="image-placeholder" style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;"><em>[Image Intended: The Oldest Edition of Beowulf]</em></div>
<p>In this text, Beowulf, as a warrior and a king, fulfills the Anglo-Saxon idea of heroism in the epic poem through strength, humility, and essential goodness.Some critics, on the other hand, argue that Beowulf resembles an Aristotelian tragic protagonist, one whose hubris, or god-defying pride, leads him to nemesis—an ultimately destructive force—and catharsis—the emotional release a champion achieves at his tragic end.</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>This popular reading of Beowulf ignores the function and purpose of the epic poem as being both allegorical and instructive to its audience, the Anglo-Saxons, or whom we now call British. We can, however, garner a better understanding of Beowulf by applying the logic of Dr. Shay’s work on superstructures (for example, government, overarching systems) and how they influence the warrior (please recall the role the “commander,” or REMF, plays in the betrayal of one’s moral code by deeming it “moral”) by dissecting something that may surprise you: the complex interplay of gender within Beowulf.</p>
<p>To understand the historical and thematic underpinnings of the text, it is also important to acknowledge the obvious connection between Beowulf and Grendel (in an interesting comparison, this is the inverse relationship of Enkidu and Gilgamesh). From the outset, it is obvious that the poet meant to create an immediate comparison between Beowulf and his foes, for the author describes the hero and the antagonist in parallel terms. Upon close examination, Grendel is the focus of the literary poem and likely the underlying oral tradition, for neither the mother nor the dragon was "around long enough to be named."</p>
<p>It is no accident that the Anglo-Saxon term "aglǣca" is used for both Beowulf and Grendel. The two are both "fierce fighters," equal combatants, and the true test of one another's might.</p>
<p>Considering the structure of the poem, we see that Grendel, who is so central to the poem and dominates so many of its lines, should be the creature who is given a name and a vivid identity.</p>
<p>Grendel may be related to Old English gryndal "fierce, angry" and Old Norse grindill "storm, wind"; it may also be derived from the Old English verb grindan "to grind, destroy.”</p>
<p>The text states "Grendel nemdon foldbúende," which translates roughly to "the earth-dwelling people named him Grendel." So, he was specifically named Grendel by the Danes.</p>
<p>The text often refers to Grendel with additional monstrous qualifiers (e.g., "wæs se grimma gaést Grendel háten" or "this ghastly demon was named Grendel").</p>
<p>So, it is not as if Grendel was a generic "grendel," nor is it that there were more of his kind out there. Grendel was a monster with the name "Grendel." This marks him as distinctly different from both his mother and the dragon.</p>
<p>There is also the matter of numbers:</p>
<p>Grendel can “genam thritig thegna” (“he can seize thirty men at once”).</p>
<p>According to Hrothgar, Beowulf has “thritiges manna magencruft on his mundgripe” (“the strength of thirty in his hand”).</p>
<p>A point further illustrated later on when Beowulf swims off with thirty suits of armor from Hygelac’s battle against the Franks.</p>
<p>And their murderous progenitors:</p>
<p>Beowulf’s father, Ecgtheow, was on the run for killing Heatholaf of the Wulfings (and not paying wergild).</p>
<p>Grendel descends from Cain, who is likewise on the run for his crime of killing another.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in preparation for their battle, Beowulf notes that since Grendel “for his wonhydum waepna ne recceth” –or “does not use a weapon, armor, or shield,” nor will he, thereby directly casting himself as Grendel’s equal. Beowulf and Grendel also come from essentially single-parent families and have mothers who are never clearly named. For these reasons, that the primary purpose of this text is tied up with the difference between Beowulf and Grendel.</p>
<p>Another important aspect for understanding Beowulf is the role of women. The role of a woman in Beowulf, as in Anglo-Saxon society, primarily depends on peacemaking, either biologically, through her marital ties with foreign kings as a peace pledge or mother of sons, or socially and psychologically, through her role in cup-passing and peace-weaving as the Queen within a hall. So, yes, Wealhtheow is a walking peace treaty. Whom Wealhtheow gives the cup to, and when, at dinner is part of that “peace.”</p>
<p>This societal function is unfamiliar to many modern readers, perhaps, so it requires us to make another comparison, between Wealhtheow and Grendel’s Mother:</p>
<p>Wealhtheow: described as “fithu-sibb folca” or “Peace pledge between nations”– Which nations? All “good” women in Beowulf act as “peace weavers.” She is the picture of the “Perfect Queen.”</p>
<p>Grendel’s Mother: Described as “ides agaewif,” ides = lady; algaeca = a monster, fighter, or hero. Both the Mother and Beowulf are described as “gaest” or guests. Is she a monster? A warrior? Is she a monster because she does not weave peace? Is this ideal pagan or Christian?</p>
<p>Grendel’s mother’s “action section” is also situated between the Finnsburg Episode and the scene wherein Wealhtheow seeks protection for her sons. It is worth exploring the dramatic irony of this historical digression because:</p>
<p>Modthryth is a foil for Hygd.</p>
<p>Moreover, Modthryth is only “monstrous” as long as she is single.</p>
<p>By pitting the women in the digression as foils to one another and demonstrating Modthryth’s transformation into an acceptable woman through marriage, the text’s structure pits the two main women of our story against each other. This begs the question, is Grendel’s mother, then, a foil for Wealhtheow? Please consider that Grendel’s mother may be acting as a mirror for strong Norse women like Brunhild of the Nibelungenlied, which would not have been in keeping with the Christian society, which was of a “guilt” culture in this region of the Saxony (the British Isles).</p>
<p>Critics have discussed Grendel's Mother as a peculiar brand of monster and have generally been uneasy with her femininity.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the association between the categories of monster and woman developed into criticism of Grendel's Mother as a hyper-masculine female, who is an extension of Grendel, and criticism of her as a representative of the threatening archaic feminine.</p>
<p>In this way, Grendel’s mother has a lot in common with Euripides’ Medea, coming later, and is more widely a representation of Christian ideals moving throughout Europe and designating the role of women as submissive, which was not the case in the Norse tradition.</p>
<p>As a monster, she is a threat in her very similarity to the hero; if she were truly "other," she would be beyond description. As Hala and Overing point out, the text makes her secondary to her son when she must be logically prior and excludes her from the symbolic by not giving her a name. Beowulf opposes Grendel's Mother, and she is Overing's "nameless woman" (Overing 73); her femininity is dubious at times since she is only "idese onlicnes" or "in the likeness of a woman.”</p>
<p>The danger, however, is never done away with. It is the oppositional relationship between Beowulf, as the protector of “society,” and Grendel’s mother, or the “other,” that is unstable and dangerous, rather than the sex of either. That is, of course, because Grendel's Mother also embodies the threat of "the monstrous woman," the maternal excess, the avenger, and the imitation man. However, she is more than the dark Valkyrie, or female other, so frequently found (or suspected) in medieval texts.</p>
<p>To explore this further, let us consider the Finnsburg episode and how it acts as a foil for Beowulf and the Danes. After Grendel’s death, Hrothgar even speaks of adopting Beowulf. This is both strange and important. First, it is strange because Beowulf is not a Dane! Hrothgar is acting well outside of Norse's custom to offer a bond of peace and honor without marriage. Furthermore, despite Beowulf being described as “lof-geornst” – keenest to win fame, having stated that “glory before death…will be his best and only bulwark,” and that “it is always better to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning,” Beowulf acts as a “peace-weaver” between the Geats and the Danes. This act is central to the text and notable because such vengeance often led to blood-feuds, and Beowulf’s actions are in opposition.</p>
<p>In the Hildebruth episode, the lay identifies Hnæf's last struggle as the aftermath of a battle described as Fres-wæl (the "Frisian slaughter"), and it describes the mourning of Hildeburh after a surprise attack by the Frisians on the Danes.</p>
<p>Hildeburh, Hnæf's sister, was married to Finn, leader of the Frisians, to make peace between the two tribes, though this attempt was unsuccessful and today is seen by many scholars as to the source for tragedy in the piece.</p>
<p>She mourned for the loss of her brother, Hnæf, whose funeral pyre was shared by her and Finn’s son. After the battle, Finn and a character named Hengest make a loyalty pact. Hengest is a leader among Hnæf's surviving warriors.</p>
<p>By cleansing Heorot of the curse of Grendel, Beowulf achieves a trusted friendship and bond between the Geats and the Danes–similar to what would have been expected if he had been exchanged between the two nations as the modified bride. Indeed, Beowulf's deeds create a bond with Hrothgar more durable than most of those in the poem established by intertribal marriage.</p>
<p>Thus, when Beowulf crosses tribal lines to aid Hrothgar's Danes, even though his conduct includes some sweaty brutality, Beowulf becomes distinctly feminized.</p>
<p>This is especially important when considering that genders are not constructed onto pre-existing sexed bodies; gender construction is not an act that can be deemed "finished" at a certain point (Bodies 9).</p>
<p>The performativity of gender depends on an understanding of gender construction as an ongoing process (or performance) that is never ultimately complete.</p>
<p>Within the poem, at least, male loyalty across tribal lines is very seldom cited as a virtuous trait. When cross-tribal relationships between men are mentioned, they are usually cited within the context of a female peace-weaving bond that has failed or is highly fragile. Women in Beowulf are, as Enright puts it, the "mortar that cements the bricks" (Enright 202); they facilitate relationships among men. Beowulf's meaning is clear enough in the poem:</p>
<p>"As a rule, the murderous spear will rest only for a short time under such circumstances [as a marriage bond]" (Klaeber 203)</p>
<p>It does not matter how good the bride may be. Beowulf's skepticism is hardly surprising in a poem that repeatedly emphasizes how human life is made up of transitory days. Accordingly, the other intertribal marriage discussed in the poem—that of Hildeburh in the Finnsburg episode—ends in slaughter and vendetta.</p>
<p>In Chance's words, "The efforts of the peacemaker, while valuable in worldly and social terms, ultimately must fail because of the nature of this world" (Chance 106-7).</p>
<p>Even Wealhtheow, with all her virtues, is unable to prevent the later conflagration at Heorot and the death of her entire family. Ultimately, the poet draws such strong associations to highlight not how threatening and dangerous the monsters are but rather how threatening and dangerous human beings are, or at least can be.</p>
<p>Despite their monstrous nature, the strength, appetite, and terror of the Grendelkin—and even the flames and poison of the dragon—the monsters are ineffective and defeated. The greater, more threatening force in the poem is people; Grendel can terrorize Heorot and Hrothgar, but he does not destroy the hall nor kill Hrothgar and his kin. Heorot awaits destruction in “lathan liges,” the “hateful flames” that will come in the feud between Hrothgar and his son-in-law Ingeld of the Heatho-Bards. Then Hrothulf, Hrothgar’s trusted but treacherous kinsman, will seize the throne from his cousin, Hrothgar’s son.</p>
<p>Grendel’s mother, as monstrous as she is, is only acting out the approved social code of revenge, a code reaffirmed in the lay of Hildeburh, told the very night Grendel’s mother attacks. Furthermore, while Grendel’s mother is hunted down for seeking revenge for the death of her son, Hildeburh is stripped of all right to such revenge for the death of her son, brother, and husband.</p>
<p>Likewise, the dragon, for all his destructive abilities and justifiable anger at being robbed, does not destroy the Geats; rather, the Franks, Frisians, and Swedes will obliterate the Geats, as the messenger prophesizes at the end of the poem, which has come to pass, for we still have Franks, Frisians, and Swedes, but no Geats.</p>
<p>So, what does this have to do with Dr. Shay’s work?</p>
<p>First, consider that this text is “English,” not “Norse,” and that it was transcribed by a Christian monk. This text marks a transitional period from an honor-based Norse society to a Christian Anglo-Saxon society, and it is the latter’s values that the text champions. This text, at its heart, is about what it means to be a good king, which juxtaposes Agamemnon and Beowulf as leaders. It is important to note that the difference between Scyld Scefing and Grendel is not one of violence; they are both wreckers of mead halls. The difference is one of generosity. Like Scyld, Beowulf is the ring giver, but he is also generous willing to forfeit his life. This text is about the emergence of a king who serves his people, rather than a king who expects the people to serve him. Beowulf achieves this by performing in a feminine way.</p>
<p>The Song of Roland</p>
<div class="image-placeholder" style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;"><em>[Image Intended: The Battle of Roncevaux]</em></div>
<p>As we position ourselves to analyze the Song of Roland, it is important to keep a certain sympathetic perspective: the Spain that Roland and Charlamagne are invading is the same Spain of our lovable Don Quixote. In fact, the very “pagan” Muslims Roland refers to are likely from the same Moorish community that produced the Arabic transcript from which Cervantes translated to produce the first edition of Don Quixote.</p>
<p>This historical context is important to us because the Song of Roland is a military text. More specifically, it is one of the earliest propaganda military texts ever recorded for an empire.</p>
<p>How can we know it is propaganda?</p>
<p>Here is one definition of propaganda that I like:</p>
<p>Propaganda appears in a variety of forms. It is strategic and intentional as it aims to influence attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Propaganda can be beneficial or harmful. It may use truth, half-truths, or lies. To be successful, propaganda taps into our deepest values, fears, hopes, and dreams.</p>
<p>Steven Luckert and Susan Bachrach, authors of The State of Deception, 2009</p>
<p>So, what happened?</p>
<p>It is important to note that many consider the Song of Roland a beautiful epic, rich in culture and history. It is not that simple, however, and what began as an oral epic celebrating a great knight has been transformed, due to the application of politics, into something nefarious. As we know, the Song of Roland tells the story of the ambush of Charles the Great's rearguard in the Pyrenees in the year 778, or, as Charles’ biographer Einhard relates:</p>
<p>While the war against the Saxons is being fought energetically almost continuously, Charlamagne, having stationed troops at strategic places along the borders, attacks Spain with all the forces he can muster. He crosses the Pyrenees, accepts the surrender of all the towns and fortified places that he encounters along the way, and returns without his army having sustained any losses. Except that during the withdrawal, while traversing the Pyrenees, he happened to experience Gascon treachery. While His army was marching along column because of the narrow pass, and some Gascons lying in ambush at the top of the mountain, swoop down on the last elements of the baggage train and the rearguard protecting the main body of the army. They drive them back into the Valley, join battle, and massacre every one of them.</p>
<p>This historical incident is the basis for the old French epic poem. However, three hundred years of singing and recounting this incident in the halls where the Frankish Warriors spent their nights, or on their marches where they spent their days, or even on the battlefield at Hastings, have transformed the story into a profound reflection on the culture it represents. The semi-oral nature of the epic places the Song of Roland in a similar context as the Iliad concerning the Greeks and Troy: it was changed over centuries by epic poets into the remarkable story of the wrath of Achilles and therefore holds much of the same historical and emotional renown.</p>
<p>Our reading of the Song of Roland will not be that simple, of course. In recounting a scene from the text, Dr. Richard Smith notes one of the underlying themes of this text is that the “pagans” they have routed must burn and suffer; the Muslims (misrepresented purposely as “pagan,” despite being Abrahamic for propaganda purposes) would have been converted or killed, and this can be seen through the juxtaposition of Charles and his sycophants play gayly in a garden while the inhabitants suffer and die. He claims that:</p>
<p>“God rewards the Christian Franks and spares those Saracens who accept true religion. This is the message of the garden. On the other hand, God will not spare those Saracens who persist in false religion. This is a message of Cardona’s smoking rubble.”</p>
<p>(My emphasis)</p>
<p>If we understand the poem the same way as Dr. Smith, then Turoldus, the poet, provides a positive symbol and symbolic structure for understanding Roland’s role in the poem. Like Dante in The Inferno, Roland acts as a type of figure fulfillment, wherein he is representative of Isaac, or even Christ, to Charles's hoary personage, which resembles both Abraham and God. Roland plays the sacrificial son in this interpretation. Ganelon’s betrayal of Roland for a healthy annual subsidy from Marseilles is another figure fulfillment, but for Judas. Roland’s death on a Hill beneath the pine tree, flanked by two other trees, in a temple-like enclosure only underscores this correspondence.</p>
<p>Thus, in this view, Roland is there to become a sacrifice on behalf of the Frankish army, permitted by Charlemagne, just as Christ was a sacrifice for all humankind permitted by God. Moreover, Roland is a willing sacrifice who submits himself dutifully to Charles’ command. Thus, from the Christian and Frankish viewpoint, we can see how the biblical symbolism associated with the text and the realities of feudal society and warfare complement each other while restoring Roland’s heroic stature.</p>
<p>However, if we recall that the rest of the poem is about Charles’ revenge and that Roland’s sacrifice acts as a method for justifying the annihilation of the Saracens, it is easy to see how this “positive” reading is problematic. Consider that the oldest existing manuscript of the Song of Roland, which scholars call the Oxford manuscript, is in the Bodleian Library and dated to around the year 1100, why, then, might the author of the Song of Roland have written about a battle that took place in 778, between the Franks and the native Spanish Basque peoples (certainly not Islamic, but possibly “pagan”), as if it were in a different time, place, and in conflict with an altogether different enemy?</p>
<p>By the later part of the eleventh century, when the text that we possess today was finally composed, the historical essence of the story had pretty much disappeared. It was no longer a tale of Basque treachery and Roland's death; it had become a saga of Muslim-Christian enmity and French loyalty to the cause of France and the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Dr. Shay specifically speaks to the Song of Roland. He states:</p>
<p>The Judeo-Christian (and Islamic) world view has triumphed so completely over the Homeric world view that dishonoring the enemy now seems natural, virtuous, patriotic, pious. Yet, in the Iliad, only Achilles disrespects the enemy. In Homer’s world, this is not a natural but an inhuman state into which Achilles has tragically fallen. Homer’s warriors are never weakened by respecting the enemy… [and] the veteran’s self-respect never fully recovers so long as he is unable to see the enemy as worthy.</p>
<p>Demonizing the enemy leads directly to the “Betrayal of What’s Right” mentioned earlier within the text, a precursor for PTSD. Naturally, this prejudice goes both ways. Dr. Paul M. Cobb, Professor of Islamic History at the University of Pennsylvania, author of Race for Paradise: An Islamic History of the Crusades, notes in a History Channel interview that:</p>
<p>Most famously, there was an Arabic author named Ibrahim Ibn Ya’qub, who traveled around Europe in the 10th century, and his work was quoted by others. He left first-hand accounts of France, Italy, and Germany, among other places. We learn, for example, of the lushness of the land in Bordeaux, feasting practices in Germany, even whaling practices near Ireland. For all these, he was pleased by the land but appalled by the people he met. “They do not bathe except once or twice a year, with cold water,” he wrote. “They never wash their clothes, which they put on once for good until they fall into tatters.” What you have is a classic strategy by which one society “others” another society—much as Europeans did to Muslims.</p>
<p>He also draws a comparison between the Crusades and the Jihad:</p>
<p>There is a family resemblance because they share roots in monotheism, where God is a jealous God. And both Crusades and Jihad offered martyrdom to those who die. But while they look alike, they have some important differences. Crusades were directed at the liberation of the sacred land considered rightfully Christians, whereas Jihad was about rescuing souls.</p>
<p>With all of this information in mind, I hope that a picture has begun to form: as the Franks gear up for a second Crusade, the Frankish government co-opts a cherished historical tale into a propagandistic text meant to demonize the Islamic communities that live where the Franks want to invade and occupy (and this is something Americans will also do a bit later in history). Moreover, there is clear and obvious misinformation throughout the text: Muslims are not Pagan (in fact, the very idea that they would worship an idol is ludicrous), Roland was killed by Christian Basques, and the invasion had little to do with faith.</p>
<p>In the end, it seems as if politics affected not only the epic’s historical context but also the Christian message of honor and sacrifice that Roland originally represented.</p>
