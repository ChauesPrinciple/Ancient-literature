            <p>There are three major themes that the Bhagavad Gita illuminates: knowledge (jnana), action (karma),
                and love (bhakti):</p>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--accent-red);">Knowledge (Jnana)</h3>
                    <p>Krishna shows Arjuna that his grief is misplaced since the eternal soul, unlike the body, cannot
                        be slain.</p>
                    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                        <li>Krishna urges Arjuna to acquire discriminative wisdom (i.e., the ability to distinguish the
                            eternal from the transient).</li>
                        <li>One acquires this wisdom by cultivating steadiness of mind, which Krishna compares to a lamp
                            unflickering in a windless place.</li>
                        <li>Attainment of the mental stability requires practice, especially yoga postures (“stopping
                            the whirlpools of the mind”), which help to concentrate the mind. The body is a vehicle for
                            helping the mind come to repose.</li>

                        <li>Krishna asks Arjuna to renounce not the worldly life or action itself, but instead the
                            fruits of action. One must bring steadiness of mind into action: yoga is “skill in action.”
                        </li>
                        <li>The four <em>purushartas</em> or goals of life are <em>kama</em> (pleasure or passion),
                            <em>artha</em> (wealth or power), <em>dharma</em>, and <em>moksha</em> (freedom).
                        </li>
                        <li>On the field of dharma, one should act without passion (<em>nishkama</em>) and without
                            desire for the fruits of action (<em>nishphalaratha</em>). Through yoga, one can cultivate a
                            disinterestedness in or detachment from the outcome of action.</li>

                    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                        <li>God – <em>Bhagavan</em> – is the supreme reality that is both ultimate and personal.</li>
                        <li>Krishna teaches a lesson of divine presence: “Though I am unborn, I come into being in age
                            after age, whenever dharma declines and adharma is on the rise” (Bhagavad Gita 4). This is
                            the first articulation of divine descent or <em>avatara</em>.</li>
                        <li>At Arjuna’s request, Krishna reveals his supreme form, which Arjuna perceives with a special
                            third eye.</li>
                        <li>Arjuna responds with love to Krishna’s revelation. Only through love can one perceive
                            Krishna’s true form.</li>
                        <li>Krishna reveals his love for Arjuna, saying: “Abandoning all dharma, come to me alone for
                            refuge…”</li>
                        <li>Love can subvert dharma; there is no need to consider dharma when one consecrates one’s acts
                            to God.</li>

                <strong>Five Reasons to Fight</strong>
                <p>Arjuna is worried about entering the battle and destroying his own family, so Krishna begins by
                    explaining five reasons why Arjuna should not be troubled by this. Essentially Krishna shows
                    Arjuna why he will not get bad karma from taking part in the war.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first reason Krishna mentions is that because <em>atman</em> (the Self) is eternal, it
                        is a mistake to think that one can kill someone. What happens is that people are sent to the
                        next stage of reincarnation.<br>
                        <em>“[Krishna speaking] One believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain.
                            Both are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. You were never born; you will
                            never die. You have never changed; you can never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable,
                            immemorial, you do not die when the body dies.”</em> (Bhagavad Gita 2:19-20)
                    </li>

                    <li style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The second reason why Arjuna should fight is because of honor
                        and duty. (The root of the word <em>dharma</em>, commonly translated as “duty,” is from the
                        Sanskrit root <em>dhr</em> – meaning “what holds things up or sustains. Dharma, here refers
                        to the way in which aligning one’s decisions to dharma duty hold together the proper order
                        of things, and this is why Krishna the sustainer, is the manifestation appearing now to
                        Arjuna.) Arjuna is a member of the warrior class; the battle is the very reason for his
                        existence within this particular order now.</li>

                    <li style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The third reason Krishna gives is that inaction is impossible.
                        Withdrawing from battle is in itself a conscious decision; <strong>not choosing is still a
                            choice</strong>. This is, in a way, a criticism of some worldviews, such as asceticism,
                        which claim that leaving everything behind is inaction. Withdrawing from society is always a
                        deliberate act.</li>

                    <li style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The fourth reason given by Krishna is that the source of evil is
                        not in actions but in passion and desires, the intentions behind the actions. This brings
                        the dialogue to the last reason.</li>

                    <li style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The fifth and last reason is that there are ways to act where we
                        can do what we have to do without getting bad karma.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Three Ways to Act Without Bad Karma</h3>
                <p>In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains three ways to act without getting bad karma.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jnana yoga (the way of knowledge)</strong>: This idea is based on the Upanishads and
                        holds that life and death are not real. Selfhood is nothing but an illusion. All we see are
                        manifestations of the one. Once we realize that the one is behind all things, we can escape
                        the bad karma from acting: <em>“[Krishna speaking] I am ever present to those who have
                            realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never
                            separated from me.”</em> (Bhagavad Gita 6:30)</li>

                    <li><strong>Bhakti yoga (the way of devotion)</strong>: This is an idea developed in great
                        detail in Hinduism and holds that our actions can be dedicated to Krishna by surrendering
                        our will to him, and he will take upon himself any bad karma.</li>

                    <li><strong>Karma yoga (“the way of action” or “the way of works”)</strong>: The idea behind
                        Karma yoga is acting without attachment; in other words, to act without being so concerned
                        about the outcome of our actions. According to this view, if we act in such a way as not to
                        get attached to the fruits of our actions, we can be more effective. Sometimes emotions like
                        fear, embarrassment, or anxiety can interfere with the outcome of what we do.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>It is essential when we approach the Gita to understand that it is not literal. The battlefield is
                not the actual battlefield but the battlefield that exists in our minds. However, the concepts
                Krishna touches on should be taken seriously, and whether to kill or not is at the core of Arjuna's
                struggle. Like our subsequent text, Beowulf, this text is a guide for proper action. Beowulf will
                explore what it means to be a good, generous king in an Anglo-Saxon culture that centers around
                "guilt and fairness" while the Gita examines what it means to be a warrior within an honor-centered
                culture, like the Iliad.</p>
            <p>Dharma, in a non-religious sense, can also be understood as a duty on a grander scale. We have
                explored the implications of what it means to live and function within a zero-sum honor culture and,
                viscerally, how inaction is impossible through Elijah Wood's Code of the Streets. Here, however, I
                would like to take a different focus: when is it wrong to kill, and why does Krishna push Arjuna
                towards the annihilation of his own family? Let us look at these lines from Chapter II:</p>
            <p>…but wrongful deem</p>
            <p>The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol</p>
            <p>The letter of their Vedas, saying, "This</p>
            <p>Is all we have, or need;" being weak at heart</p>
            <p>With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes--they say--</p>
            <p>As "fruit of good deeds done;" promising men</p>
            <p>Much profit in new births for works of faith;</p>
            <p>In various rites abounding; following whereon</p>
            <p>Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>Look! like as when a tank pours water forth</p>
            <p>To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw</p>
            <p>Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.</p>
            <p>But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward</p>
            <p>Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be</p>
            <p>Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.</p>
            <p>And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts</p>
            <p>Thy piety, casting all self aside,</p>
            <p>Contemning gain and merit; equable</p>
            <p>In good or evil: equability</p>
            <p>Is Yog, is piety!</p>
            <p>Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results. Here Krishna informs Arjuna that we have
                the right to do our duty, but the results are not dependent only upon our efforts. Several factors
                come into play in determining the results according to Krishna—our efforts, destiny (our past
                karmas), the will of God, the efforts of others, the cumulative karmas of the people involved, the
                place, and situation (a matter of luck). If we become anxious for results, we will experience
                anxiety whenever they are not according to our expectations. So, Shree Krishna advises Arjun to give
                up concern for the results and instead focus solely on doing a good job. The fact is that when we
                are unconcerned about the results, we can focus entirely on our efforts, and the result is even
                better than before.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. To perform actions is an integral
                part of human nature. While performing these actions, we must remember that we are not the enjoyers
                of the results. Thus, a primary determiner of what is right or moral is intent rather than the
                result. How does this apply to war and death? Please keep this in mind for context with one of our
                later texts, Song of Roland, where the epic's entire purpose is to destroy an idea: someone else's
                faith.</p>
            <p>Here Krishna is outlining why and how it is wrong to desire to kill an idea.</p>
            <p>We often mistake our distaste for emotion or an idea as a dislike of the person and for killing the
                body. For example, if someone makes us feel angry, we may think to ourselves, "I want to kill this
                person." However, the thing we want to "kill" is that angry thought within our heads. We wish to
                eliminate the thought that vibrates within the person's head, not necessarily the person we may end
                up killing. If we are part of a party, like a political party, for example, and then someone stands
                against the party's ideals, the consensus may be to kill that person. However, we could not stop
                with one, could we? Since it is the idea we wish to kill, it would require killing every person who
                had that idea.</p>
