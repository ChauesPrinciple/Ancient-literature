            </p>

            <p>Euripides lived during the Golden Age of Athens from 484 B.C.E. to 406 B.C.E. Euripides was a philosopher
                and playwright whose works often challenged the social norms of his time. Although not a Sophist,
                Euripides incorporated elements of sophistic thinking into his plays, particularly the relationships
                among language, truth, and perception. His works are known for presenting controversial, radical ideas
                about human nature and society.</p>

            <p><em>Medea</em> won third prize at the Dionysia festival in 431 B.C.E., the same year the Peloponnesian
                War began. The Peloponnesian War was a conflict between Athens and the Peloponnesian League, led by
                Sparta. As tensions rose between the Greek city-states, the war created social and political upheavals,
                challenging the institutions of democracy and power that shaped Greek society. <em>Medea</em>, like
                other plays from this period, such as <em>Lysistrata</em>, reflects these societal tensions.</p>

            <p>Jason, leader of the Argonauts, was given the task of capturing the Golden Fleece, a powerful and magical
                item. Jason sailed aboard the Argo, journeying to Colchis, where he met Medea, the daughter of King
                Aeëtes. Medea, a powerful sorceress, fell in love with Jason and helped him complete his quest,
                betraying her own family in the process. She and Jason fled to Corinth, where they lived in exile and
                had two sons. In <em>Medea</em>, Jason has abandoned Medea to marry Glauce, the daughter of King Creon
                of Corinth. Medea is enraged at being dishonored and abandoned.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>

            <p>In <em>Medea</em>, Euripides presents one of the most shocking female characters in literature. While
                Lady Macbeth famously contemplates killing her child, Medea takes that horrific step, murdering her two
                sons. The play is set in the ancient Greek city-state of Corinth. Jason, having left Medea, has married
                the Princess of Corinth. In the play's opening, Medea is grief-stricken and furious, lamenting her
                betrayal and abandonment.</p>

            <p>Her desire for revenge drives the play’s action, and her hatred towards Jason is understandable. She
                sacrificed everything—her family, homeland, and future—for Jason, who now discards her for another
                woman. Medea’s decision to kill her children is driven by a desire to obliterate Jason’s happiness
                completely. If the children survive, Jason would still have a source of comfort. While Jason has
                undeniably wronged Medea, nothing justifies her ultimate decision to commit filicide. Medea’s internal
                struggle before the murder is chilling. She briefly wavers, torn by her maternal instincts, but her
                overwhelming hatred for Jason overpowers any remaining love for her sons.</p>

            <p>Euripides argues that tragedy unfolds when hate becomes stronger than love. The play explores the
                consequences of unchecked rage, offering the following meditations:</p>

            <div class="callout" style="border-left-color: var(--accent-neon-cyan);">
                <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><em>"All men love themselves more than their neighbors."</em>
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><em>"There is no justice in the eyes of mortal men. Everyone
                            avoids a friend once he is a pauper."</em></li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><em>"I’d sooner have great fame than houses filled with gold or
                            the power to sing melodies sweeter than Orpheus."</em></li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><em>"I pray that moderation, the gods' most beautiful gift, will
                            always guide me."</em></li>
                    <li><em>"As for human life, it is nothing but shadows among human beings. No one is happy. Wealth
                            may flow to make one man luckier than another, but no man is ever truly happy."</em></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The chorus, comprised of Corinthian women who are Medea's friends, serves as the voice of Greek society.
                They try to console her, but Medea remains inconsolable as the play’s tension rises. King Creon arrives
                to banish Medea and her children, fearing she may harm his daughter. Medea pleads for one more day, and
                Creon reluctantly grants her request. In that brief time, Medea devises a deadly plot to murder Jason’s
                new wife.</p>

            <p>Jason appears, offering to help Medea in her exile. Medea reminds him of all she sacrificed to aid him in
                his past endeavors. Jason dismisses her sacrifices, claiming he did more for her than she ever did for
                him. Medea scorns his offer, asserting that gifts from a traitor are worthless.</p>

            <p>Feeling abandoned with no family, no home, and no hope, Medea resolves to carry out her deadly plan. Soon
                after, a messenger arrives from Creon’s palace to report that both the princess and Creon are dead.
                Medea’s poisoned robe and crown have consumed them in a fiery death. Medea then enters her house to kill
                her children. Their cries echo as she commits the unimaginable act.</p>

            <p>Jason arrives too late, hearing that Creon and the princess are dead. He rushes to stop Medea but finds
                his sons already slain. In the play’s resolution, Medea escapes on a winged chariot, a gift from her
                grandfather Helios, carrying the bodies of her children. As she flies away, she taunts Jason, leaving
                him devastated and powerless.</p>
