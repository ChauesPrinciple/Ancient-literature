            </header>

            <article class="prose">
                <p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>e cannot end this course without speaking some truth to power. There
                    is a question that has likely been pulling on the back of our minds if it has not already burst upon
                    the scene:</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    What about the women?
                </div>

                <p>We have experienced firsthand the problematic portrayal of “dangerous” women who act in a masculine
                    way, as exampled by Pandora, Ishtar, Grendel’s Mother, the forced conversion of Bramimonde, and
                    possibly even Gertrude (shoutout to the mastermind!); This aspect will be explored further through
                    Medea, Lysistrata, the women in One Thousand and One Nights, and the Wife of Bath as we read this
                    final chapter.</p>

                <p>When women are not being treated as monstrous, they are often subservient, or even objectified, as
                    exampled by the way Gilgamesh treats the women of his kingdom, the way Briseis and Chriseis are
                    treated as a prize, the way Wealhtheow is treated as a peace treaty, and the way Ophelia is treated
                    as having no agency.</p>

                <h3>The Book of the City of Ladies</h3>
                <p>However, we will end this chapter with the first text written by a woman, for women, in the Western
                    literary tradition: <em>The Book of the City of Ladies</em>. In many ways, de Pizan’s work is the
                    beginning and essence of Feminism; it is a book by a woman, who is speaking about women in a
                    positive way with feminine terms. The femininity is being celebrated for its unique strengths,
                    rather than being considered the antithesis of it because they are not men.</p>

                <h3>Julia Kristeva</h3>
                <p>To do this, we will borrow concepts from the Bulgarian-born French literary critic and philosopher
                    Julia Kristeva. She is an influential authority in many fields of study, from literary criticism to
                    psychoanalysis to anthropology and psychology, and thus, we will view the women in this chapter
                    through Kristeva’s feminine lens.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>Ferdinand de Saussure</strong>
                    <p>For Saussure, the relational nature of the world emerges from a vision of language as a
                        generalized abstract system.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sound-image</strong> vs <strong>Concept</strong> (Signifier vs Signified)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With this theory, Saussure rejects the Western tradition that treats language like an entity or
                        an instrument. For him, language is a creative process, not a thing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout">
                    <strong>Mikhail Bakhtin</strong>
                    <p>For Bakhtin, the relationship between the author, the work, and the reader originates from the
                        existence of the world within specific social registers.</p>
                    <p>He advocates that there is a mutual relationship between meaning and context. Much of language
                        use is also intertextual. Bakhtin sees language as an ongoing, unending chain of meaning, which
                        is constantly renewed and reborn through each link in the chain.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Intertextuality</h3>
                <p>Kristeva was influenced by both Saussure and Bakhtin’s theories, and it is through the combination of
                    these theories that Kristeva’s notion of intertextuality emerged.</p>

                <p>Kristeva established a new model of semiotics, which she calls <strong>semi-analysis</strong>. She
                    emphasizes in this approach the idea that texts are always in a state of production, rather than
                    being products to be quickly consumed. In her view, ideas are not presented as finished consumable
                    products but are presented in such a way as to encourage readers to come up with their own
                    interpretation.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    “Any text is constructed of a mosaic of quotations and any text is the absorption and transformation
                    of another.” — <strong>Julia Kristeva</strong>
                </div>

                <p>Texts do not present clear and stable meanings. They embody society's conflict over the meaning of
                    words. Thus, intertextuality deals with a text’s existence within society and history. Texts have no
                    unity, or unified meaning, of their own; they are thoroughly connected to ongoing cultural and
                    social processes.</p>

                    <p>For a deeper underrstanding of how these concepts apply to our lives now, today, take the time to
                        reflect on the following podcast episode:</p>
