<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that in the following translation the numbers without brackets refer to the English text, while the numbers in square brackets refer to the Greek text. In numbering the lines, the translator has normally counted a short indented line with the short line immediately above. The stage directions and explanatory endnotes have been provided by the translator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In this translation, possessives of words ending in -s are usually indicated in the common way (that is, by adding <em>-’s</em> (e.g. <em>Zeus</em> and <em>Zeus’s</em>). This convention adds a syllable to the spoken word (the sound <em>-iz</em>). Sometimes, for metrical reasons, this English text indicates such possession in an alternate manner, with a simple apostrophe. This form of the possessive does not add an extra syllable to the spoken name (e.g., <em>Pentheus </em>and <em> Pentheus’</em> are both three-syllable words; whereas, <em>Pentheus’</em>s has four syllables).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BACKGROUND NOTE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Jason was born the son of Aeson, king of Iolcus, a city in Thessaly (on the eastern coast of mainland Greece). When his father lost the kingship, Jason was secretly sent away and put into the care of the famous centaur Chiron, who raised him. As a young man Jason returned to Iolcus. The king, Pelias, who had deprived Aeson of the kingship, persuaded Jason to set off on an expedition to capture the Golden Fleece, the pure gold skin of a ram, which was in a sacred grove in Colchis (a barbarian region to the east of the Euxine sea, the Greek name for the Black Sea), where it was guarded by a dragon.</span><br><br><span>Jason put together a band of adventurers called the Argonauts. They took their name from the ship they sailed in, the Argo. The heroes had a number of adventures on the way to Colchis. When they arrived in Colchis, king Aeetes set Jason a number of tasks, including yoking two fire-breathing bulls, ploughing a field with them, sowing the field with the teeth of a dragon, and then fighting the warriors who arose from the sown teeth. He also had to confront the dragon guarding the fleece.</span><br><br><span>To complete these tasks Jason enlisted the help of Medea, daughter of king Aeetes. She fell in love with Jason and used her magic to help him complete the tasks set by Aeetes and to steal the Golden Fleece. She then escaped with Jason, killing her brother in order to scatter his body on the sea, so that Aeetes would have to hold up his pursuit. Jason and Medea returned to Iolcus, where Medea<span>’</span>s magic restored Jason<span>’</span>s father, Aeson, to youthful health. Medea also tricked the daughters of king Pelias into killing their father by giving them ineffective medications and persuading them to try a course of treatment which was fatal. Because of their culpability in the death of Pelias, Jason and Medea were forced to leave Iolchus. They moved to Corinth, where, after a few years, Jason decided to leave Medea and marry the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth. The story of the play begins immediately after Jason’s marriage to his new bride.</span></p>

<p><span>Women of Corinth, I have come out here,</span><br><span>outside the house, so you won’t think ill of me.</span><br><span>Many men, I know, become too arrogant,</span><br><span>both in the public eye and in their homes.</span><br><span>Others get a reputation for indifference,</span><br><span>because they stay at ease within the house.</span><br><span>There’s no justice in the eyes of mortal men.</span><br><span>Before they know someone’s deep character,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>250</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span>[220]</span><br><span>they hate the sight of her, though she’s not hurt them.</span><br><span>A guest of the city must comply, of course,</span><br><span>act as the city wants. I don’t commend</span><br><span>a stubborn man, not even a citizen,</span><br><span>who thanks to his stupidity annoys</span><br><span>his fellow townsmen. But in my case,</span><br><span>this unexpected blow that’s hit me</span><br><span>has destroyed my heart. My life is over,</span><br><span>dear friends. I’ve lost all joy. I want to die.</span><br><span>The person who was everything to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>260</span><br><span>my own husband, has turned out to be</span><br><span>the worst of men. This I know is true.</span><br><span>Of all things with life and understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>[230]</span><br><span>we women are the most unfortunate.</span><br><span>First, we need a husband, someone we get</span><br><span>for an excessive price. He then becomes</span><br><span>the ruler of our bodies. And this misfortune</span><br><span>adds still more troubles to the grief we have.</span><br><span>Then comes the crucial struggle: this husband</span><br><span>we have selected, is he good or bad?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>270</span><br><span>For a divorce loses women all respect,</span><br><span>yet we can’t refuse to take a husband.</span><br><span>Then, when she goes into her husband’s home,</span><br><span>with its new rules and different customs,</span><br><span>she needs a prophet’s skill to sort out the man</span><br><span>whose bed she shares. She can’t learn that at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span>[240]</span><br><span>Once we’ve worked hard at this, and with success,</span><br><span>our husband accepts the marriage yoke</span><br><span>and lives in peace—an enviable life.</span><br><span>But if the marriage doesn’t work, then death&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>280</span><br><span>is much to be preferred. When the man tires</span><br><span>of the company he keeps at home, he leaves,</span><br><span>seeking relief for his distress elsewhere,</span><br><span>outside the home. He gets his satisfaction</span><br><span>with some male friend or someone his own age.</span><br><span>We women have to look at just one man.</span><br><span>Men tell us we live safe and secure at home,</span><br><span>while they must go to battle with their spears.</span><br><span>How stupid they are! I’d rather stand there</span><br><span>three times in battle holding up my shield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>290</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>[250]</span><br><span>than give birth once.

But I’m alone.</span><br><span>I have no city, and I’m being abused</span><br><span>by my own husband. I was carried off,</span><br><span>a trophy from a barbarian land.</span><br><span>I have no mother, brother, or relation</span><br><span>to shelter with in this extremity.</span><br><span>And so I want to ask something from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>300</span><br><span>If I find some way to punish Jason&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>[260]</span><br><span>for these injustices—his bride, as well,</span><br><span>and her father—say nothing.

Before that happens,</span><br><span>I’m taking some precautions.

Some say I’m hostile.</span><br><span>I’m not that clever, but still you fear me.</span><br><span>Have I hurt you at all, made you suffer?</span><br><span>Don’t fear me, Creon.

At this point,</span><br><span>I trust you even less than previously.</span><br><span>Passionate people, women as well as men,</span><br><span>are easier to protect oneself against,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>[320]</span><br><span>than someone clever who keeps silent.</span><br><span>No. You must leave Corinth—and right away.</span><br><span>No more speeches. I have made up my mind.</span><br><span>It’s not possible for you to stay here,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>380</span><br><span>not with us, given your hostility to me.</span></p>

<p><span>MEDEA </span> <em> <span>[kneeling in front of Creon]</span></em></p>
<p><span>No, don’t send me away. I’m begging you,</span><br><span>at your knee, in your daughter’s name.</span></p>

<p>Your words are useless. You won’t persuade me.</p>

<p><span>Woman, it seems I’ll need to give good reasons,</span><br><span>and, like a skilled helmsman on a ship,</span><br><span>haul in my sails and run before that storm</span><br><span>blowing from your raving tongue.

<p><span>In the gods’ name, have you lived so long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; [670]</span><br><span>without ever having any children?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>Not one. Some god is doing this to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>Do you have a wife? Or have you stayed unmarried?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>No, I am married. My wife shares my bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>So what did Apollo say about it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 800</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>Words too wise for human understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>It is appropriate for me to learn them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>Of course. They need a clever mind like yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>What was the prophecy? Tell it to me—</span><br><span>if it’s all right for me to hear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me this:</span><br><span>“Don’t untie the wineskin’s foot. . .”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until when?</span><br><span>Until you do what or reach what country?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; [680]</span></p>

<p>“. . . until you come back to your hearth and home.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>What were you looking for when you sailed here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>A man called Pittheus, king of Troezen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp; 810</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>He’s Pelops’ son. They say he’s a very holy man.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>I want to share the god’s prophecy with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>He’s a wise man and skilled in things like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>And the friendliest of all my allies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>Well, good luck. I hope you find what you desire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>Why are your eyes so sad, your cheeks so pale?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>O Aegeus, my husband has been cruel—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [690]</span><br><span>of all men he has treated me the worst.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p><span>What are you saying? Tell me truly—</span><br><span>what things have made you so unhappy?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 820</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>Jason’s abusing me. I’ve done him no harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>What has he done? Give me more details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>He’s taken a new wife. She now rules his home,</span><br><span>instead of me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s completely shameful.</span><br><span>He hasn’t dared something like that, has he?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>Indeed, he has. He’s dishonored me, the wife</span><br><span>he used to love.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a new love affair,</span><br><span>or did he get fed up with you in bed?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>A new love match—he’s betrayed his family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>Leave him, then, since, as you say, he’s worthless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 830</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>His passion is to marry royalty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>Who’s giving her to him? Tell me the rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>Creon, who rules this land of Corinth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p><span>Then, lady, it’s quite understandable</span><br><span>why you’re in such distress.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m done for, finished.</span><br><span>I’m being banished from this country</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>By whom? You’re speaking now of some new trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>Creon is driving me into exile,</span><br><span>forcing me out, away from Corinth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>With Jason’s full consent? I find that disgraceful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp; 840</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>He says not. Still, he’s planning to accept it.</span><br><span>But, Aegeus, I beg you by your beard,</span><br><span>and at your knees implore you—have pity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [710]</span><br><span>Take pity on me in my misfortune.</span><br><span>Don’t let me be exiled without a friend.</span><br><span>Accept me as a suppliant in your home,</span><br><span>your native land. If you will take me in,</span><br><span>may the gods then answer your desire</span><br><span>to have children. May you die a happy man.</span><br><span>You don’t know what a lucky one you are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 850</span><br><span>to find me here. I’ll end your childlessness.</span><br><span>I know the sorts of medicines to use,</span><br><span>and I can help you have many children.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p><span>Lady, I’d like to grant this favour to you,</span><br><span>for many reasons. First, there’s the gods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [720]</span><br><span>Then, for the children you say I’ll produce.</span><br><span>For there I’ve lost all sense of what to try.</span><br><span>Here’s what I’ll do. If you get to my country,</span><br><span>I’ll strive to treat you as a foreign guest—</span><br><span>that’s the proper thing for me to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 860</span><br><span>But, Medea, I’ll give you fair warning:</span><br><span>I won’t plot to get you out of Corinth.</span><br><span>If you can reach my household on your own,</span><br><span>you may stay there in safety. Rest assured—</span><br><span>I won’t surrender you to anyone.</span><br><span>But you must make your own escape from here.</span><br><span>I don’t want my hosts finding fault with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [730]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>That’s fine with me. If you could promise this,</span><br><span>you’ll have done me all the good you can.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p>Don’t you trust me? What in this still bothers you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;"> 870</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>I do trust you. But the house of Pelias</span><br><span>dislikes me, and so does Creon’s, too.</span><br><span>If you bind yourself to a promise now,</span><br><span>you’ll not hand me over when they come,</span><br><span>seeking to remove me from your country.</span><br><span>If you use words, and don’t swear by the gods,</span><br><span>you may become their friend and then comply</span><br><span>with their political demands. I’m weak,</span><br><span>and they have wealth, a king’s resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [740]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>
<p><span>What you’ve just said is very shrewd. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> 880</span><br><span>if it’s what you want, I’m not unwilling</span><br><span>to do what you require. Your proposal</span><br><span>gives me some security. I can show</span><br><span>those hostile to you I’ve a good excuse.</span><br><span>And it makes your position more secure.</span><br><span>Tell me the gods that I should swear by.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>Swear by the plain of Earth, by Helios,</span><br><span>my father’s father, by the family of gods,</span><br><span>by all of them collectively.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>Never to cast me out from your own country.</span><br><span>And if some enemy of mine asks you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [750]</span><br><span>if he can take me off, you’ll not agree,</span><br><span>not while you’re still alive.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>That’s good. And if you betray this promise,</span><br><span>what happens to you then?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AEGEUS</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>All is well. Now, go your way in peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>900</span><br><span>I’ll come to your city as quickly as I can,</span><br><span>once I’ve completed what I mean to do,</span><br><span>and my plans here have been successful.</span></p>

<p><span>Lady, I approve of what you’re saying now.</span><br><span>Not that I blame you for what went on before.</span><br><span>For it’s quite natural in the female sex</span><br><span>to get angry when their husbands set up</span><br><span>secret schemes for another secret marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; [910]</span><br><span>But your heart has changed now for the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1070</span><br><span>Although it took a while, you understand</span><br><span>the wiser course of action.

With the gods’ help,</span><br><span>I’ve made secure provision for you both.</span><br><span>At some future date, you’ll be leaders here,</span><br><span>in Corinth, alongside your new brothers.</span><br><span>But first you must grow up.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>I will cheer up. I trust what you have said.</span><br><span>But it’s a woman’s nature to shed tears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 1090</span></p>

<p>JASON</p>
<p>But why be so tearful with the boys?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>I gave birth to them. When you made that prayer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; [930]</span><br><span>about them growing up, I felt pity,</span><br><span>wondering how things would turn out for them.</span><br><span>But let’s discuss the reasons for your visit.</span><br><span>I’ve mentioned some. Now I’ll let you know the rest.</span><br><span>Since the rulers here are keen to banish me,</span><br><span>I recognize the best thing I can do</span><br><span>is try not to stand in their way or yours,</span><br><span>by staying here. This royal house thinks me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1100</span><br><span>their enemy. So I’ve made up my mind</span><br><span>to leave this country and go into exile.</span><br><span>But you should beg Creon to spare our boys,</span><br><span>not banish them, so they can grow up here,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; [940]</span><br><span>under your direction.</span></p>

But I should try.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>You could tell your wife to ask her father</span><br><span>not to send the children into exile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JASON</p>
<p>A good idea. I think I can persuade her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>You will, if she’s a woman like the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 1110</span><br><span>And I’ll give you some help. I’ll send her gifts,</span><br><span>by far the finest human gifts I know,</span><br><span>a finely woven gown, a diadem</span><br><span>of twisted gold.

<p><span>She’s got more than one reason to be happy,</span><br><span>that wife of yours.

<p>MEDEA</p>
<p><span>Don’t say that. Even the gods, they claim,</span><br><span>are won by gifts.

<p><span>My lady, your children won’t be exiled.</span><br><span>The royal bride was happy to accept,</span><br><span>with own hands, the gifts you sent her.</span><br><span>Now the boys have made their peace with her.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MESSENGER</p>
<p><span>When your two children came with their father</span><br><span>and entered the bride’s home, we servants,</span><br><span>who had shared in your misfortune, were glad,</span><br><span>for a rumour spread at once from ear to ear</span><br><span>that you and your husband’s previous quarrel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [1140]</span><br><span>was now over. Someone kissed the boys’ hands,</span><br><span>someone else their golden hair. In my joy,</span><br><span>I went with the children right inside,</span><br><span>into the women’s quarters. Our mistress,</span><br><span>whom we now look up to instead of you,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 1350</span><br><span>before she caught sight of your two children,</span><br><span>wanted to fix her eyes on Jason only.</span><br><span>But then she veiled her eyes and turned away</span><br><span>her white cheek, disgusted that they’d come.</span><br><span>Your husband tried to change the young bride’s mood,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [1150]</span><br><span>to soften her anger, saying these words,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>“Don’t be so hard-hearted with your family.</span><br><span>Check your anger, and turn your face this way,</span><br><span>look at us again, and count as friends of yours</span><br><span>those your husband thinks are friends of his.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 1360</span><br><span>Now, receive these gifts, and then, for my sake,</span><br><span>beg your father not to exile these two boys.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once she saw the gifts, she did not hold out,</span><br><span>but agreed in everything with Jason.</span><br><span>And before your children and their father</span><br><span>had gone any distance from the palace,</span><br><span>she took the richly embroidered gown</span><br><span>and put it on, then arranged the golden crown,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>[1160]</span><br><span>fixing it in her hair at a bright mirror,</span><br><span>smiling at her body’s lifeless image there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 1370</span><br><span>Then she stood up from her seat and strolled</span><br><span>across the room, moving delicately</span><br><span>on her pale feet, delighted at the gifts,</span><br><span>with a great many glances to inspect</span><br><span>the straightness of the dress against her legs.</span><br><span>But then it happened—a horrific sight.</span><br><span>She changed colour, staggered back and sideways,</span><br><span>trembling, then fell into her chair again,</span><br><span>almost collapsing on the floor. An old woman,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; [1170]</span><br><span>one of her servants, thinking it was a fit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1380</span><br><span>inspired by Pan or by some other god,</span><br><span>shouted in festive joy, until she saw</span><br><span>the white spit foaming in her mouth, her eyes</span><br><span>bulging from their sockets, and her pale skin</span><br><span>quite drained of blood. The servant screamed again—</span><br><span>this time, to make up for her former shout,</span><br><span>she cried out in distress. Another slave</span><br><span>ran off at once towards her father’s palace,</span><br><span>and another to the girl’s new husband</span><br><span>to tell him the grim fate his bride had met.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> 1390</span><br><span>The whole house rang with people’s footsteps,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [1180]</span><br><span>as they hurried back and forth. By the time</span><br><span>it would take a fast runner to complete</span><br><span>two hundred yards and reach the finish line,</span><br><span>her eyes opened—the poor girl woke up,</span><br><span>breaking her silent fit with a dreadful scream.</span><br><span>She was suffering a double agony—</span><br><span>around her head the golden diadem</span><br><span>shot out amazing molten streams of fire</span><br><span>burning everything, and the fine woven robe,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span>1400</span><br><span>your children’s gift, consumed the poor girl’s flesh.</span><br><span>She jumped up from the chair and ran away,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [1190]</span><br><span>all of her on fire, tossing her head, her hair,</span><br><span>this way and that, trying to shake off</span><br><span>her golden crown—but it was fixed in place,</span><br><span>and when she shook her hair, the fire blazed</span><br><span>twice as high. Then she fell down on the ground,</span><br><span>overcome by the disaster. No one</span><br><span>could recognize her, except her father.</span><br><span>Her eyes had lost their clear expression,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span>1410</span><br><span>her face had changed. And there was blood</span><br><span>across her head, dripping down, mixed with fire.</span><br><span>The flesh was peeling from her bones, chewed off</span><br><span>by the poison’s secret jaws, just like resin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; [1200]</span><br><span>oozing from a pine tree. An appalling sight!</span><br><span>Everyone was too afraid to touch the corpse—</span><br><span>what we’d seen had warned us. But her father,</span><br><span>poor wretch, didn’t know what she’s been through.</span><br><span>He came unexpectedly into the house</span><br><span>and stumbled on the corpse. He cried aloud,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 1420</span><br><span>embraced his daughter and kissed her, saying,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>“My poor child, what god has been so cruel</span><br><span>to destroy you in this way? Who’s taken you</span><br><span>away from me, an old man near my death?</span><br><span>O my child, I wish I could die with you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [1210]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>He ended his lamenting cries. But then,</span><br><span>when he tried to raise his old body up,</span><br><span>he was entangled in that woven dress,</span><br><span>like ivy wrapped around a laurel branch.</span><br><span>He struggled dreadfully, trying to get up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 1430</span><br><span>onto his knees, but she held him down.</span><br><span>If he used force, he tore his ancient flesh</span><br><span>clear from his bones. The poor man at last gave up.</span><br><span>His breathing stopped—he could not stand the pain</span><br><span>a moment longer. So the two of them lie dead—</span><br><span>the daughter, her old father, side by side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span>[1220]</span><br><span>It’s horrible, something to make one weep.</span><br><span>Concerning you there’s nothing I will say.</span><br><span>For you’ll know well enough the punishment</span><br><span>that’s coming to you. As for human life,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; 1440</span><br><span>it seems to me, and not for the first time,</span><br><span>nothing but shadows. And I might say,</span><br><span>without feeling any fear, those mortals</span><br><span>who seem wise, who prepare their words with care,</span><br><span>are guilty of the greatest foolishness.</span><br><span>Among human beings no one is happy.</span><br><span>Wealth may flow in to produce a man</span><br><span>more lucky than another, but no man,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; [1230]</span><br><span>is ever happy, no one.</span></p>

Now I understand—</span><br><span>I must have lost my mind to bring you here,</span><br><span>from that savage country, to a Greek home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> [1330]</span><br><span>You were truly evil then—you betrayed</span><br><span>your father and the land that raised you.</span><br><span>But the avenging fury meant for you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span> 1590</span><br><span>the gods have sent to me. You slaughtered</span><br><span>your brother in your home, then came aboard</span><br><span>our fine ship, the Argo. That’s how you began.</span><br><span>When you married me and bore my children,</span><br><span>in your lust for sex and our marriage bed,</span><br><span>you killed them. No woman from Greece would dare</span><br><span>to do this, but I chose you as my wife&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <span>[1340]</span><br><span>above them all, and that has proved to be</span><br><span>a hateful marriage—it has destroyed me.</span><br><span>You’re not a woman.

So be off,</span><br><span>you shameful murderer of your children.</span><br><span>Let me lament my fate. I’ll get no delight</span><br><span>from my new bride, nor will I ever speak</span><br><span>to my own living children, the two boys</span><br><span>I bred and raised.

<p>MEDEA</p>
<p>No. It was an insult—your new marriage.</p>

<p><span>Never.
