                    Chaucer's Pilgrims on Horse Back</p>

                <p>Geoffrey Chaucer, who wrote <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>, is often cited as the
                    father of English poetry. Chaucer lived in the second half of the 14th century, toward the end of
                    what we now call the Middle Ages. It was a time of tremendous change in Europe
                    generally and in Britain specifically, and the Renaissance was just around the corner. Chaucer’s
                    most famous work, <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>, is both a look back on nearly 350 years of British
                    society and a glimpse of what was to come.</p>
                <p>The Norman Conquest of 1066 marks the end of the Anglo-Saxon
                    dominance in the British Isles; this is the culture that produced <em>Beowulf</em>.
                    However, the Normans and the Anglo-Saxons were tribal cousins; both were
                    Germanic tribes who came to Britain from Scandinavia. William of Normandy, soon to
                    be known as William the Conqueror, led the Norman invasion of
                    Britannia in 1066. He was related to the Anglo-Saxon Kings that he conquered, and like
                    Hamlet, it was his lineage and belief of his entitlement to the
                    crown that spurred him to action. His aim, therefore, was to conquer the Anglo-Saxons
                    and not to eliminate them. In December of 1066, he named himself William the First,
                    the King of England. Within five years, he took control of nearly all of Britannia, which he ruled
                    without difficulty until his death in 1087. With William’s ascendancy to the throne, French
                    culture and the French language dominated the island of Britannia for the next 300
                    years. The Normans never left the island and merged with the Anglo-Saxons to become the
                    English we think of today.
                </p>
                <p>Let us look at the aristocracy. One of William’s most important initiatives was
                    commissioning an inventory of British property and possessions known as The Domesday
                    Book (<em>Doomsday</em>). William’s people scoured the cities and the countryside,
                    counting every landowner, every peasant, every building, every chicken, every cow, and every bushel
                    of wheat. This inventory allowed William to collect taxes. The more someone owned, the more money
                    William could demand of him. The entire Domesday Book is now online, and it is a fascinating read.
                    One striking thing is that anyone who owned anything of consequence had a Norman name and thus was a
                    Norman aristocracy member. Virtually no one who owned anything of consequence had an Anglo-Saxon
                    name. In a mere 20 years, the entire Anglo-Saxon ruling class was eliminated and replaced by an
                    entirely new ruling class from Normandy. It should be no surprise, then, to learn that with the
                    Norman Conquest, French became the aristocracy’s language. It was a rough country
                    dialect of French, not the fancy stuff they spoke in Paris. However, it was French, and, more
                    importantly, it was the official language of the British Royal Court and the
                    official language of the British state. Simultaneously, in farmhouses and fields
                    across the island, English Saxon was still spoken by the rural people and the
                    peasantry.</p>
                <p><strong>Feudalism</strong>, of course, was a comprehensive hierarchical system of social, political,
                    and economic relationships. It claimed God as its ultimate authority, which is a
                    clever and practical tactic if one happens to be the King. Furthermore, it was a top-down
                    power system, with virtually no mobility among its various levels, especially the lower
                    levels. In contrast, the knight was the symbol of the feudal system, and the idea
                    of loyalty was central to an entire series of social behaviors and codes. To break
                    any of these codes was to risk the welfare of oneself and that of the entire system. We can detect
                    the not-so-subtle whiff of <strong>comitatus</strong> here. The dramatic concept of
                    <strong>comitatus</strong> was
                    the blueprint for the feudal system of the Middle Ages. Like so many other things in England during
                    the Middle Ages, feudalism was an import from France introduced by William the
                    Conqueror immediately after the Norman Conquest. However, it slowly began to erode over time as
                    ordinary people gained greater control over their lives.</p>
                <p>Under the feudal system, a critical aspect of aristocratic conduct was the <strong>Chivalric
                        code</strong>. The <strong>Chivalric code</strong> demanded loyalty to one’s Lord and determined
                    behavior on the battlefield. However, it also elevated women to an ideal: an image of
                    perfection impossible to achieve (one of the problematic portrayals of women that
                    persist today). <strong>Courtly love</strong> was also a central and essential aspect at the heart
                    of the <strong>Chivalric Code</strong>, which held the knight to serve the Lady of his
                    Devotion bravely and most honorably. In the name of the Lady, <strong>courtly love</strong> is the
                    subject of hundreds of medieval stories. Perhaps most famous of these was the Arthurian
                    Romances detailing King Arthur’s and the Knights of the Round Table’s
                    exploits. The obvious example of <strong>courtly love</strong> gone awry is Lancelot and Guinevere,
                    yet it is also important to note that King Arthur’s legend preexisted the Norman
                    invasion. Lancelot and his tryst with Guinevere is solely a French addition to
                    the canon.
                </p>
                <p>The reality for women in the Middle Ages differed considerably from the stuff of
                    legend and lore. Aristocrat or serf, women’s place in society was narrowly defined. Their first and
                    primary duty was not to maintain their virginity forever but to fulfill the demands of reproduction
                    once they were sexually mature enough to do so, much more accurately portrayed by Chaucer.
                    Peasant women were child bearers first and foremost; the house and field duties
                    were a close second. The feudal society also expected aristocratic women to produce
                    lots and lots of children. While they oversaw the house rather than cleaning it for themselves,
                    they, too, had no real place outside of these roles. In all cases, women depended heavily on their
                    spouses for support.
                </p>
                <p>Also, looming large in the Middle Ages were the Crusades: European Christianity’s
                    three and a half centuries-long series of Holy Wars against Muslims began shortly
                    after the Norman Conquest. Ultimately, the quest to take over
                    Jerusalem was unsuccessful, but the Crusades’ effect on life at home was a mess. As
                    Europeans went East, they were exposed to Arabic cultures, establishing trade at
                    bringing back both consumer goods and new forms of knowledge.
                    These helped cities such as London to grow, thus offering an alternative to the feudal system. One
                    of the primary sources of urban growth was trade. As soldiers and traders returned
                    from Eastern lands with a wide array of consumer goods, teas, spices, fabrics, and
                    foods, a new and vital group of people emerged: the merchant class.
                    With each passing decade, the merchant class’s economic and social power grew, and
                    they became highly influential members of society. During the Middle Ages, large groups of
                    craftsmen often assembled into Guilds. Furthermore, contact with the Middle East
                    led to the acquisition of new forms of knowledge, especially in the
                    sciences, mathematics, and architecture. As a result, European cities became
                    centers of learning in the 13th century. London saw the founding of two universities: Oxford
                    and Cambridge, offering a challenge to the traditional European institutions of
                    learning, the Christian monasteries.

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>When <em>The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale</em> was written, England was undergoing significant
                    social changes. These changes gave rise to a burgeoning merchant class, represented by the Wife of
                    Bath, who defies traditional gender roles. Women in the Middle Ages could typically occupy one of
                    three social positions: maiden, wife, or widow. The Wife of Bath is an unusual character in medieval
                    literature because, as a widow, she controls her wealth and her destiny. This economic independence
                    allows her to express views on marriage, sexuality, and gender roles that would have been considered
                    subversive in her time.</p>
                <p>In the Prologue, the Wife of Bath (whose name is Alyson or Alys) recounts her
                    experiences with five husbands. She defends her multiple marriages by citing Scripture, challenging
                    the church's teachings on marriage. She describes her first three marriages to older men, whom she
                    manipulated to secure financial independence. Her fourth marriage was more contentious, as her
                    husband was a philanderer. She retaliated by pretending to be unfaithful. Her fifth husband,
                    Jankyn, was physically abusive, once striking her so hard that she lost hearing in
                    one ear. Despite this, she claims to have loved him the most because he ultimately conceded control
                    to her after a heated argument.
                </p>
                <p>The Friar interrupts her lengthy prologue, prompting her to begin her tale.</p>
                <p>In the Tale, a knight in King Arthur's court rapes a young maiden.
                    Instead of executing him, the Queen gives him a chance to redeem himself by answering the question,
                    "What do women most desire?" He has one year to find the answer, or he will be executed. The knight
                    embarks on a journey, asking many women, but none give him a satisfactory answer. Just before his
                    time runs out, he encounters an old, ugly woman who promises to give him the answer if he agrees to
                    marry her. Desperate, the knight agrees. The woman tells him that women most desire sovereignty over
                    their own lives. When the knight presents this answer to the Queen, she spares his life.</p>
                <p>The knight is unhappy with his new wife, and on their wedding night, he begs her to release him from
                    the marriage. She gives him a choice: he can have her as a beautiful but unfaithful wife, or an ugly
                    but loyal one. The knight wisely responds by leaving the choice to her. Delighted by his submission,
                    the old woman transforms into a beautiful young woman and promises to be both faithful and
                    beautiful. Thus, the knight learns the lesson of granting his wife sovereignty, and they live
                    happily ever after.</p>
