<h1>The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale</h1>
<h2 style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Professor's Analysis</span></h2>

<p style="text-align: center; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 84, 106); font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">A Middle English Edition of Canterbury Tales</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"><i>The Wife of Bath’s Tale</i> is referring to an Arthurian Romance. The “tale” recaptures the historic days of Arthur, and it is the only actual example of Arthurian romance that Chaucer wrote. He was attracted to Romance and displayed his appreciation for the genre throughout his other tales, but he only wrote the one Arthurian Romance, which he then assigned to the Wife of Bath! Alyson’s tale uses a standard convention of the Romance genre, opening with a juxtaposition between the “now” of the text (late Medieval) and the past that it depicts (Arthurian). We will often see and hear nostalgic statements about bygone eras, like the tried and true “love was different back in my day.” This, of course, implies that the present time is somehow deficient; for instance, the friar seeing a woman in a position of power as an example of how the current society was corrupt. Chaucer employs a pretty standard convention of Romance; however, <b>he renders that cliché form specifically to support the tale and its narrator, the wife</b>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">So, the Wife of Bath tells us that in Arthur’s days, the whole land was full of the fanciful, supernatural, and faery world. In contrast, the presence of Friars essentially means that the culture of the friars has permanently displaced the Faery lands; where the elf used to walk, now the friar walks. She tells us that Friars are “as thick as…”&nbsp; These descriptions help communicate the sense that they are everywhere. These Friars get into every single space, and it accomplishes the satirical jab in a more poetic and resonant manner than saying friars are everywhere.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">At the same time, this digressive moment for the Wife of Bath indicates her engagement in anti-fraternal satire. These satirical attacks on the Friars were also a prevalent mode of writing in the 14th century. Indeed, she is picking up on some mainstays of this kind of anti-fraternal satire. So, the idea of Friars being as thick as specks of dust in the sunlight is ironic given that Friars have often likened this kind of satirical writing to things like flies and bees. Chaucer’s contemporary William Langland writes about a figure called the friar, which he gave the name Sir <b>Penetrans-Domos</b>, meaning <i>the penetrating of the home</i>. So, Chaucer combines anti-fraternal satire and a conventional element of Romance, the juxtaposition of the past and the contemporary. However, he renders it sharply pointed at this moment because it is part of the Wife of Bath’s attack on the Friar, and it contributes to the roadside drama of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;"><i>The Wife of Bath’s Tale</i> is also, of course, an example of the <b>loathly lady stereotype</b>, and this is a stereotype that was pervasive in the Middle English tradition and literature from the Middle Ages. However, it is also indicative of the overall abjection of women in this period of world history. It is helpful to juxtapose these different versions to get a sense of what is distinctive in Chaucer’s rendition. There are two I want to focus on. One is known as <i>The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle.</i> This middle English tale features Sir Gawain, Arthur’s nephew, one of the critical Knights of the Arthurian World, and his marriage to the Loathly Lady. The other is called <i>The Tale of Florent</i>, and it forms part of the collection <i>Confessio Amantis</i>, a collection of tales written by John Gower, Chaucer’s friend and contemporary. In both of these versions, Gawain’s romance and the tale of Sir Florent follow a similar pattern. Gawain and Sir Florent both have the quest to find what women most desire. They get the answer in return for marrying the Loathly Lady. On the wedding night, they are given a choice: How will they have her in the future? They can either have the loathsome woman be beautiful by day but ugly by night or ugly by day and beautiful by night. It is a choice between whether they will prioritize private desire, personal satisfaction, and fulfillment, or their public reputations. By handing the sovereignty over to the Loathly Lady and allowing her to choose, they are rewarded by her magical transformation, as it turns out that this was all an enchantment that was placed on her by her stepmother.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">That is, of course, how this trope works in other works mentioned. Chaucer, however, makes several significant contributions to this type of tale. In Chaucer’s version, neither the Knight nor the Loathly Lady, where she is only ever called the old lady, is ever named. <b>They are not given names</b>. Secondly, he makes a particular action of the knight the crime of rape, and therefore <b>the connection between the crime and the punishment is more explicit</b>. <i>He committed rape</i>, and he must now go and find out what it is that women most desire. Next, he does not give any explicit details of the “loathness” of the Loathly Lady. For the other writers I have mentioned, they devote quite many lines to describe how hideous she was, and contemporary authors enjoy doing this. Chaucer says,</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt 0.5in; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><a name="TALE"><b>Thou art so loothly, and so oold also,</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art so loathsome, and so old also,<br>1101 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>And therto comen of so lough a kynde,</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And moreover descended from such low born lineage,<br>1102 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>That litel wonder is thogh I walwe and wynde.</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That little wonder is though I toss and twist about.<br>1103 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>So wolde God myn herte wolde breste!"</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So would God my heart would burst!"</a></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">you could not imagine or describe a fouler creature. He uses <b>inexpressibility tropes</b> here to describe just how ugly she is. Now Romance is full of these kinds of inexpressibility tropes, but <b>they are usually employed to describe the beauty of heroin</b>. Chaucer inverts the trope to describe the loathness of the older woman.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">The last thing Chaucer does is to make the Knight’s reservation and hesitation on his wedding night not just about how ugly she is but also about her social status. She has come from so low a status, which is part of what makes the Knight toss and turn in bed and distress. Through the older woman as a representative of the “lower class,” Chaucer redefines what gentility meant through her speech. Gentility means <b>both</b> <i>nobility of one’s rank</i> and <i>the status and the nobility of one’s character</i> in the Middle English sense. The older woman’s speech comprises a quarter of the Tale's length and is one hundred lines long. <b>Thus, it is meant to be taken seriously</b>. The older woman, in her arguments, detaches the nobility of rank from the quality of nobility of character when it comes to her gentility. This subject has already been interrogated by romance because, after all, we have a Knight who commits the crime of rape. However, in her speech, she clarifies that they do not necessarily reside in the same person. He who is noble in status is certainly not always going to be noble in character.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">The next thing that Chaucer does is to change the nature of the choice that the Knight must make. Will he choose for her to be the ugly and old but faithful and obedient wife, or will he choose for her to become the beautiful, young, and by implication, likely to be unfaithful wife. Finally, unlike in other versions of this trope of the Romantic genre, wherein a curse is a cause for the Loathly Lady’s condition, <i>The Wife of Bath’s Tale</i> has no external actor inflicting this upon the older woman, now his wife. The implication here is that she can self-transform or she can shapeshift. Chaucer has created a robust and independent representative of the woman’s experience, and Alyson is heralded by many as one of English literature's first feminist figures. Through the satire of this text, Alyson articulates the core desire of the feminist movement; women want one thing: sovereignty and equal representation that perceives feminine characteristics on equal terms as masculine ones.</span></p>
