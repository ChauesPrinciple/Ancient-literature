                <h2>Metafiction</h2>
                <p>Metafiction often employs intertextual references and allusions by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>examining fictional systems,</li>
                    <li>incorporating aspects of both theory and criticism,</li>
                    <li>creating biographies of imaginary writers,</li>
                    <li>presenting and discussing fictional works of an imaginary character.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Authors of metafiction often violate narrative levels by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>intruding to comment on writing,</li>
                    <li>involving his or herself with fictional characters,</li>
                    <li>directly addressing the reader,</li>
                    <li>openly questioning how narrative assumptions and conventions transform and filter reality,
                        trying to prove that no singular truths or meanings exist ultimately.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Metafiction also uses unconventional and experimental techniques:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>rejecting conventional plots,</li>
                    <li>refusing to attempt to become "real life,"</li>
                    <li>subverting conventions to transform "reality" into a highly suspect concept,</li>
                    <li>flaunting and exaggerating the foundations of and the instability of their ideas,</li>
                    <li>displaying <strong>reflexivity</strong> (a function which enables the reader to understand the
                        processes by which he or she reads the world as a text).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Blending Reality and Fiction</h2>
                <p>Another overarching theme of Don Quixote is the blending of reality and fiction, both in the real
                    world in which we live and the fictional world in which Don Quixote lives. In the case of Don
                    Quixote, it is impossible to discuss the real-world events behind the book without delving into some
                    of the themes of the book itself because Cervantes himself blends reality so effectively. By the end
                    of the book, even the reader does not know what truth or fiction is.</p>

                <div class="callout-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #d4edda 0%, #c3e6cb 100%); border-left: 4px solid #28a745; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">Don Quixote, the character himself, is perceived as being a
                        <strong>madman</strong>, although he is also described as being <strong>very sane</strong>.
                        There is a clear contrast between Don Quixote's perception of roadside Inns as castles, of
                        himself as a Noble Knight errant, and the fact that he is often remarked as being philosophical
                        and wise when remarking on any subject except for knight-errantry. This duality provides the
                        basis for the blending or blurring of reality itself.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Cervantes as Narrator</h3>
                <p>One of the first and most notable uses of this blurring technique comes from the author of the book,
                    and by the author, I do not mean Miguel de Cervantes, although he was the man who wrote the text. He
                    claims in the prologue to the first part of Don Quixote that he is not, in fact, the "father" of Don
                    Quixote; he is the <strong>stepfather</strong>, merely stumbling across the manuscript and
                    translating it. Thus, he acts not as the actual creator but simply as the messenger.</p>

                <p>Now, this narrator becomes a character within the book itself and will be separated from the action
                    described within the text; however, he often remarks upon it, noting several passages as being
                    apocryphal, commenting upon the narrative itself, why he translates certain things the way he did,
                    or why he puts certain parts of the book in certain places.</p>

                <p>Now, this narrator character even goes so far as to further distance himself from the actual author
                    of the story by saying that he only found the first eight chapters of the manuscript. At the
                    beginning of chapter nine, he says that he ran out of manuscripts and ultimately tells a long-winded
                    tale of how he came across the rest of it. He stumbled upon the notebooks and loose leaves of paper
                    comprising the manuscript accidentally and bought them from a local. The manuscript was written in
                    Arabic, but the narrator's character does not speak it. The narrator, "Cervantes," describes going
                    to the local cathedral and finding an Arabic moor to be able to translate the rest of the text.
                    Thus, he is not even the translator anymore; he is just the Messenger.</p>

                <h3>Cervantes Inside the Story</h3>
                <p>If that was not enough to blur the lines of the reality of who on earth is writing this text,
                    Cervantes offers himself up as an actual named person within the book! At the end of the first part
                    of Don Quixote, there is a character known as <strong>the captive</strong>, and his story, or "The
                    Captive's Tale," tells of his being captured on the Mediterranean by Barbary Pirates and taken to
                    Algiers, serving as a slave. The captive makes the escape of his own accord, though, something
                    Cervantes was never able to achieve. Cervantes was ransomed, however, and all these experiences
                    harken back to Cervantes' own. He weaves his own story into the text, even going so far in the tale
                    of the character to name himself as one of the officers involved in the original scuffle. His full
                    name was <em>Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</em>, and the captive makes mention of having served with
                    an officer Saavedra, so Miguel de Cervantes ultimately injects even his person and his namesake into
                    the book.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3cd 0%, #ffeeba 100%); border: 2px solid #856404; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>It gets even stranger.</strong> The first part of the book, which
                        Miguel de Cervantes published in 1605, ultimately becomes the <strong>MacGuffin device</strong>
                        that moves the narrative within the second part of the book. Early in the second part, Sancho
                        Panza comes to Don Quixote and says that he ran into a man in town who says he has heard of Don
                        Quixote and Sancho Panza. The reason that he is familiar with their adventures is that <em>he
                            has read them in a book</em>. The book that we are reading is the device in the book that we
                        are reading! It is upside down.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Three Types of Satire</h2>
                <p>Cervantes' initial (overt) purpose is to satirize the romances of chivalry, to create a parody of a
                    literary type characterized by supernatural deeds of valor, implausible and complicated adventures,
                    duels, and enchantments. The literature that expresses the medieval spirit of chivalry and romance
                    has degenerated by Cervantes' time.</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">His method of showing the inherent silliness of chivalric romances is "to show
                        what extraordinary consequences they would lead a man insanely infatuated with them, once this
                        man set out to live 'now' according to their patterns of action and belief."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>In addition to chivalric romances, Cervantes parodies the <strong>pastoral novel</strong> in the
                    section about Marcela, the shepherdess who is unmoved by her shepherd admirers.</p>

                <p>Don Quixote is known for being a <strong>satire</strong>, which means it employs irony, exaggeration,
                    ridicule, or humor to provide a criticism of something. It is not just one satire; however, it is
                    <em>two competing satires in the same story</em>.
                </p>

                <div style="background: #f8d7da; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <h3 style="color: #721c24; margin-top: 0;">Juvenalian Satire</h3>
                    <p>A satire that attacks its subjects with <strong>personal invective and general cynicism</strong>.
                        It seeks change through outrage, attacks superfluous academic jargon, and can be seen in the
                        (outer) frame of our story, where Cervantes has provided fake reviews for his own work.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Juvenalian satire style was named for an early Roman poet Juvenal. This
                        style of satire is crucial in understanding Don Quixote because, through metafiction, the
                        Juvenalian satire comprises the bulk of the story's first layer of satire.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #155724; margin-top: 0;">Horatian Satire</h3>
                    <p>A satire that uses <strong>indulgence, tolerance, amusement, and wit</strong> to make the readers
                        laugh at themselves. Chivalry and art are the targets, and this can be directly applied to the
                        tale within the frame.</p>
                    <p>The aim is to make the reader laugh not only at the subject of the criticism but also at
                        themselves when they bear a resemblance to it. For instance, when Quixote sets the galley slaves
                        free, he believes them to be unjustly punished. As repayment for his service, he asks only that
                        they make a pilgrimage to his imaginary Princess and tell her the story. They instead beat him
                        up and ran off into the countryside with his things.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: #004085; margin-top: 0;">Menippean Satire</h3>
                    <p>Uses a <strong>variety of styles and tones</strong> to create a critical discourse about a high
                        concept. Bakhtin, a widely renowned Russian philosopher, lists these characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is usually more comic than Socratic dialogue.</li>
                        <li>Its fantasies create extraordinary situations for the purpose of testing philosophical
                            truth.</li>
                        <li>It mixes the fantastic, symbolic, and even quasi-religious with a "crude slum naturalism."
                        </li>
                        <li>It is "a genre of 'ultimate questions,'" combining bold invention with broad philosophical
                            reflection.</li>
                        <li>It uses "experimental fantasticality," that is, "observation from some unusual point of
                            view."</li>
                        <li>It often represents unusual states of insanity, split personality, dreams, and excessive
                            passion.</li>
                        <li>Scandals, eccentricities, inappropriate speech, violations of politeness are very
                            characteristic.</li>
                        <li>It is full of contradictory behavior and characters.</li>
                        <li>It combines elements of social utopia with other satiric elements.</li>
                        <li>It inserts a variety of other genres, often to parody them.</li>
                        <li>Hence it is "multi-styled" and "multi-toned."</li>
                        <li>It is concerned with current topics.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Though a fool and a nuisance, the character of
                        Don Quixote is ultimately a <strong>force of good</strong>. His romantic mania inspires bravery,
                        hope, joy, and initiative. Cervantes may portray him as exuberant and brash in the first part,
                        but in the second, he becomes moderate, thoughtful, and helpful; the villains turn out to be
                        those who scorn and abuse the dreamer, robbing him and the rest of the world of his great
                        impossible dream.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Exploring Menippean Satire</h2>
                <p>While Cervantes employs all three types of satire, it is Menippean satire that speaks to the deeper
                    meaning behind his satirical approach. Here are some ways we can explore this concept:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our hero, Don Quixote, dons the mask of a chivalric knight to make his life more exciting and
                        bearable.</li>
                    <li>We can see the influence of Greek comedy on this novel: a crazy idea is proposed, and the rest
                        of the work concerns how it plays out in the real world.</li>
                    <li>The humor lies in the contrast between Don Quixote's ideals and the real world around him.</li>
                    <li>French Jesuit Francois de la Noue warned against the dangerous influence of chivalric books on
                        the young and claimed they were as harmful to the young as Machiavelli was to the old.</li>
                    <li>Plato made very similar claims.</li>
                    <li>Don Quixote is not a knight but an impoverished country landowner.</li>
                    <li>His ideals include love as 'service,' adventurousness, loyalty to valor, and generosity. He
                        tries to seek out wrongs and correct them, to help those in need, and to be full of valor in
                        honor of his Lady (courtly love).</li>
                    <li>Like Greek heroes, he wants his marvelous deeds to be sung.</li>
                    <li>Don Quixote is described as a wandering hero whose insanity is caused by reading too many books
                        about chivalry (<em>literature corrupts</em>).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Class, Race, and Historical Context</h2>
                <p>While class and racial prejudice are at the heart of Cervantes' satire, in context, these critiques
                    cannot be directly spoken of as "truth to power," at least not for Cervantes. For a frame of
                    reference, one of his targets was the <strong>Spanish Inquisition</strong>, which tended to burn its
                    detractors at stake. He also takes aim at the slave trade, which was not a position to take for the
                    faint of heart and was very dangerous.</p>

                <p>To put this in perspective, <strong>Quijano</strong>, the name Cervantes chose for the protagonist,
                    is notably and distinctly middle class; this is our inroad for understanding Cervantes' complex
                    critique of the politics and economics of the time:</p>

                <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Quijano's Economic Condition</h4>
                    <p>His Grandfather was once a hidalgo, but the days of that prosperity are reflected in the
                        condition of the armor that Quixote ultimately dons: this ideal Spanish knight is now nothing
                        but rot.</p>

                    <h4>Rocinante</h4>
                    <p>The horse's name translates to "the best of all workhorses," which reflects the economic
                        situation that the knight is forced to ride upon, not a true steed. Consider the line when
                        Cervantes refers to Rocinante's hoof, that it possessed "with more quartos than a real and more
                        blemishes than the steed of Gonela." This is a nearly untranslatable pun on the word "quarto,"
                        which means a sand-crack in a horse's hoof, as well as the coin equal to one-eighth of the real.
                        This is a direct reference to the <strong>terrible inflation</strong> that had occurred in
                        Spain.</p>

                    <h4>The Book Burning Scene</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The scene with Quixote's friends: the priest secures the keys to the
                        library from Quixote's niece and attempts to sort the offending books from the innocent ones.
                        The niece implores him to pile them all in the corral and set them on fire, but the Priest
                        insists on examining the titles to avoid the risk of destroying good books with the bad.
                        Nevertheless, he soon tires of the effort and orders the housekeeper to take all the "large
                        books" to the corral. This is a <strong>direct reference to the Spanish Inquisition</strong>.
                        There is no real way for the Inquisition to know who is a heretic in their minds, and Cervantes
                        mirrors how the process for identifying who or what was "good" quickly devolved as they
                        ultimately burned whatever book they could.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Connection to Song of Roland</h3>
                <p>This text is also rooted in real-world politics and history. Quixote himself references another text
                    we will read this semester, <em>The Song of Roland</em>. This is important for two reasons: first
                    when we read Song of Roland, we may be confused that all the Spanish are depicted as heretics. For
                    instance, <strong>Bernardo del Carpio</strong>, whom Quixote celebrates as an iconic knight, is the
                    same knight that killed Roland!</p>

                <div class="conclusion-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e2e3e5 0%, #d6d8db 100%); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">This is also relevant to the fact that the actual author of Quixote's story
                        wrote this in <strong>Arabic</strong>, and it was translated by a <strong>Moor</strong>. These
                        Arabs are the very "heretics" that the government is attempting to expel via the Inquisition,
                        even though they had been a part of the Spanish culture for hundreds of years, peacefully.</p>
