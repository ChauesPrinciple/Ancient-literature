                <h1>Don Quixote</h1>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
                <p>Don Quixote and Sancho</p>
                <p>We are going to be discussing one of the most important and influential works in all classic
                    literature: <em>The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote de La Mancha</em> by Miguel de Cervantes. A little
                    background on the author himself: Miguel de Cervantes was born on or around September 29th, 1547.
                    Not a lot is known about his early life; it is theorized the young Miguel studied under the Jesuits,
                    learning to read and write. His father was a Hidalgo, a part of the nobility; the family itself was
                    poor, and we do know that Miguel ultimately left Spain in 1570. As a result of disagreements with
                    local law enforcement, young Miguel had wounded a man in a duel. Making his way to Italy, he joined
                    up with the Spanish forces stationed there. While there, he fought in the naval battle of Lepanto in
                    1571 against the Turks. Cervantes served with distinction despite injuring his left arm, a wound
                    that would plague him throughout the remainder of his life. He continued to serve for the next five
                    years until 1575. He was ultimately furloughed and was making his way back to Spain when, despite
                    having served with the military for five years, Miguel was captured by Barbary Pirates and taken to
                    Algiers to serve as a slave for another five years. Miguel attempted to escape three times but was
                    unsuccessful each time.</p>
                <p>In 1580, he was finally ransomed and did make his way back to Spain. It was at this point that he
                    began to write plays, and because he was ultimately unable to make his living through his pen, he a
                    job as a tax collector in the province of Andalucía. Tax collecting proved to be just as unpopular a
                    job in the 1580s as it is today, and a young Cervantes wound up in several tussles and disputes. He
                    served time in jail several times. It was while he was imprisoned in Sevilla that he wrote the
                    introduction to the first part of Don Quixote and came up with the idea for his ingenious Hidalgo.
                    Don Quixote appeared before the public in 1605, the first part having been printed in 1604. The book
                    proved successful and sold out several printings. Cervantes spent the following ten years in
                    crafting the second part of his famous novel. Unfortunately, before Miguel could publish his genuine
                    second part, a false second part of the adventures of Don Quixote appeared before the public in
                    1614. The book was written under the pseudonym of Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda. Cervantes
                    published his actual second book shortly thereafter. </p>
                <p>In Don Quixote, Cervantes draws attention to how the imagined “realities” of chivalric legends gained
                    credibility in Spanish society and literature. Instead of indicating their fictitious components,
                    chivalric romances often presented themselves as historical accounts and referenced other well-known
                    sources to add realism to the imagined “realities” they created. In the prólogo to Don Quixote,
                    Cervantes complains “to a friend” that he does not have enough learned references for anyone to take
                    his story seriously. His friend replies, telling Cervantes, “no hay más sino que vos procuréis
                    nombrar estos nombres, o tocar estas historias en la vuestra, que aquí he dicho, y dejadme a mí el
                    cargo de poner las anotaciones y acotaciones” (12) “all you have to do is to manage to quote these
                    names or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to me to insert the annotations and
                    quotations” (Ormsby 12). The author also prefaces his story with sonnets and letters from fictitious
                    persons of importance. Cervantes mimics both the <strong>archetypal</strong> tale of the chivalric
                    knight with his tale, as well as how writers of chivalric tales would fabricate many references to
                    produce ethos. By filling the physical reality of his novel with a prólogo full of references to the
                    Bible and antiquity and fictitious sonnets and letters, Cervantes invites his readers to read the
                    work as a parody of the mythos of chivalric culture and books of chivalry. </p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Part 1 – 1605 </p>
                <p>When the story finally opens, we meet the protagonist, a man named Alonso Quijano. This guy is old,
                    and he is not your typical protagonist; we do not get his actual age, but we will say he is sixty or
                    so, about the age of our author. For the 16th century, that age would be well into the nineties in
                    modern life expectancy. He is described as old, scraggly, and tall. Quijano spends all his time
                    reading books, and not just any books: Romantic novels with the Knight Errant hero, in shining
                    armor, and the damsel in distress. He spends his days obsessively reading these books. The narrator
                    intones that Quijano has lost it, or at least, according to those around him. He is to the point
                    that not only does he read the books all the time, but he starts to believe that they are real and
                    that he himself is a Knight in shining armor.</p>
                <p>Thus convinced, he decides that he is going to fully embody his role as the Knight in shining armor
                    and go out into the world and live out the stories in his books. The first story is about how he
                    gets ready to go out into the world: he commandeers his grandfather or great grandfather’s armor
                    (from a time when the Knight Errant was a significant part of Spanish society); this old, rusted
                    armor has green oxidation all over it, and he twines it together with string. He tries to test how
                    durable it is, so he runs with this Lance that he also picked up from his grandfather’s stash, and
                    the armor crumbles apart. He ties it up again with more string (and maybe some duct tape, or
                    whatever the equivalent duct tape was in the 16th century), and this time he does not even try to
                    test it. This demonstrates the depth of Quijano’s delusion. He cannot test it anymore because if he
                    sees it is falling apart, he is going to start falling apart. </p>
                <p>When Don Quixote arrives at the inn, he thinks that it is a castle, and the prostitutes are beautiful
                    maidens. The dwarf opens the drawbridge for him to enter his imaginary world. Everyone in the inn
                    laughs at him because of his ridiculous thoughts and actions except for one man who decides to play
                    along with Quixote’s imagination and knights him so that he can leave immediately without hurting
                    anyone else.</p>
                <p>The innkeeper advises Don Quixote that knights need to carry some extra clothes and money. On his way
                    back to La Mancha, he hears someone crying from a bush. He discovers Andres, who says that John
                    Haldudo the Rich is whipping him for no good reason. The master claims that Andres owes him unpaid
                    wages, but Andres insists that the master is lying about this. Quixote sides with the boy against
                    his master and thinks justice has been served when the master agrees to pay him promptly. However,
                    once Don Quixote leaves, it becomes clear that justice has not really been done at all because
                    Haldudo continues beating up on poor Andres.</p>
                <p>Every Knight must possess three things: an appropriate name, a big noble steed, and the most
                    important, a fair maiden with an appropriate name. Don Quixote de La Mancha is born. La Mancha is a
                    place in Spain, but La Mancha also means stained, so Cervantes is suggesting naming him Don Quixote
                    to mean “of the stained one”, or of the marked one, which will be important to the Analysis. He has
                    a horse, but here is the problem: his horse is not a noble steed but a work horse. He is not only a
                    workhorse, but he is also an antique. Finally, a knight needs a proper lady in waiting to dedicate
                    all his victories to. He knows a woman in town whose name is Aldonza Lorenzo. While this sounds like
                    a nice name, back then, it was the equivalent of a “commoner,” so he knows that she is going to need
                    a better name. When Quixote is extolling his deeds to everyone and other knights ask what his lady's
                    name is, it must be proper. Thus, Aldonza Lorenzo becomes Dulcinea del Toboso.</p>
                <p>Don Quixote has returned to his home in La Mancha, but he still believes that he is a knight. His
                    niece and the others try to convince him otherwise, but they cannot. When they discuss which, books
                    need to be burned, Don Quixote interrupts them. Specifically, Don Quixote is upset because they have
                    blocked his entrance into the library. After Don Quixote is put to bed, the housekeeper burns all
                    the books. Shortly after leaving again, Don Quixote meets a man named Sancho Panza, when Don Quixote
                    realizes that he needs a squire because all the nights in old Romance novels have a squire who
                    accompanies them. He therefore convinces Sancho to join him as his squire. Sancho Panza follows
                    Quixote because Quixote promises him an island to rule. Sancho Panza, who is Quixote’s foil, is in
                    many ways the exact opposite of Quixote: he is a short, fat, and little man who rides a donkey.
                    Later in their adventures, the duo come into a field full of windmills, which, off in the distance,
                    Don Quixote has mistaken for giants. He turns to Sancho Panza and commands him to charge the giants
                    with him. Sancho, of course, disagrees. Quixote is quickly defeated by the windmill after attempting
                    to charge it with his lance. Quixote looks at the whole situation and immediately comes up with a
                    new story. He says that a wizard must have enchanted these Giants to look, act, feel, and behave
                    physically like windmills. In this scene, we see how far Don Quixote is willing to go.</p>
                <p>The two continue their adventures, which are incredibly funny but also have dark satirical
                    undertones. In one of them, he attacks a group of monks, thinking that they have imprisoned a
                    princess; in another, he battles a herd of sheep. In almost every encounter in the first book, Don
                    Quixote, Sancho, or both end up being beaten. In one such encounter, we meet a shepherdess, Marcela,
                    who refuses to be courted or married despite her beauty, which makes all men angry at her for
                    rejecting their advances. Don Quixote listens to all the lonely shepherds who have been rejected by
                    Marcela. However, there is a twist: Marcela shows up in person to flatly reject everyone’s argument,
                    saying that God has created her beauty, so he is responsible for giving her such an amazing gift
                    while at the same time making sure nobody takes advantage of it. Marcela continues to argue that
                    although many men may have fallen in love with her because of her looks, it does not mean that she
                    owes those men her body or life simply because it is their desire. Quixote, notably, sides with
                    Marcela. Later, Don Quixote acquires a metal washbasin from a barber, which he believes is a helmet
                    once worn by a famous knight. He frees a group of convicted criminals at the end of this encounter.
                    There is usually a victim whose lives Quixote is trying to change, and some whose live he does
                    change, because he is living this fantasy life of valor and knighthood. </p>
                <p>Don Quixote subsequently encounters Cardenio, who lives wild and, in the woods, because he believes
                    that Luscinda, the woman he loves, has betrayed him. Don Quixote decides to imitate him to prove his
                    love for Dulcinea is just as great and sends Sancho to deliver a letter to her. When Sancho stops at
                    an inn, he finds two of Don Quixote’s old friends, a priest and a barber, who are looking for him.
                    They decide that one of them should pose as a damsel in distress to try to lure Don Quixote home. En
                    route, they come across a young woman, Dorotea, previously betrayed by Don Fernando, who married
                    Luscinda. Dorotea agrees to pretend to be a princess whose kingdom has been seized by a giant, and
                    Don Quixote is persuaded to help her. They stop at the inn, where Don Fernando and Luscinda soon
                    arrive. Luscinda is reunited with Cardenio, and Don Fernando promises to marry Dorotea. These
                    complicated telenovela-style digressions carry an essential message about wealth, class, and
                    freedom.</p>
                <p>Later, the priest and the barber put Don Quixote in a wooden cage and persuade him that he is under
                    an enchantment that will take him to Dulcinea. Eventually, they return him home.</p>
                <p>Part Two – 1615 </p>
                <p>Part two finds Don Quixote a month older and eager to set out on his third sally, but this time many
                    of the characters have already read the first part of Don Quixote’s adventures and know about Don
                    Quixote. He learns from a student named Carrasco, who becomes his antagonist, that his adventures
                    thus far have been recorded in a very popular chivalry romance, which has made him and Sancho very
                    famous. Within a few days, Quixote and Sancho set out for El Toboso to obtain Dulcinea’s blessing.
                    Nevertheless, neither of them knows where Dulcinea lives. When they are confronted by the reality
                    that there is no such person – only a peasant girl named Aldonza, Quixote becomes convinced that
                    Dulcinea is under an enchantment that has turned her into an ordinary peasant girl.</p>
                <p>When they get back on the road, Quixote battles with the Knight of the Forest, who is Carrasco in
                    disguise, trying to trick Quixote into returning to the village. Quixote wins the battle, and
                    Carrasco skulks away in dishonor. Don Quixote and Sancho then meet a duke and duchess who are prone
                    to shenanigans. In one such ruse, they persuade the two men that Sancho must give himself 3,300
                    lashes to break the curse on Dulcinea. The duke later makes Sancho the governor of a town that he
                    tells Sancho is the isle of Barataria. There Sancho is presented with various disputes, and he shows
                    wisdom in his decisions. However, after a week in office, he decides to give up the governorship.
                </p>
                <p>The two friends continue to meet many interesting strangers. They become friends with a gallant
                    captain of thieves and a wealthy nobleman in Barcelona. Quixote battles with a mysterious Knight of
                    the White Moon, who, again, turns out to be Carrasco. This time, Carrasco wins the battle and, as
                    his prize, demands that Quixote and Sancho return to the village. Quixote grows sadder and sadder
                    and begins to lose hope of Dulcinea’s disenchantment. When they return to the village, Quixote
                    becomes very sick. One day, after a long sleep, he announces that he has regained his sanity. He now
                    scorns knighthood and detests chivalry romances. There is no more Don Quixote; he is Alonso Quijano
                    again, and, soon afterward, he dies.</p>
