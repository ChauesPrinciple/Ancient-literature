<h1 style="text-align: center;">Dante's Inferno</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Please visit Columbia's <a href="https://https://digitaldante.columbia.edu/dante/divine-comedy/inferno/inferno-1/" title="Digital Dante site">Digital Dante site</a> for the extra Canto for the close reading.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You should not be using a Canto from this reading!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Canto 1</h2>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MIDWAY upon the journey of our life<br>I found myself within a forest dark,<br>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say<br>What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,<br>Which in the very thought renews the fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So bitter is it, death is little more;<br>But of the good to treat, which there I found,<br>Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I cannot well repeat how there I entered,<br>So full was I of slumber at the moment<br>In which I had abandoned the true way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,<br>At that point where the valley terminated,<br>Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders<br>Vested already with that planet’s rays<br>Which leadeth others right by every road.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then was the fear a little quieted<br>That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout<br>The night, which I had passed so piteously</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And even as he, who, with distressful breath,<br>Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,<br>Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,<br>Turn itself back to re-behold the pass<br>Which never yet a living person left.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After my weary body I had rested,<br>The way resumed I on the desert slope,<br>So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And lo! almost where the ascent began,<br>A panther light and swift exceedingly,<br>Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And never moved she from before my face,<br>Nay, rather did impede so much my way,<br>That many times I to return had turned.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The time was the beginning of the morning,<br>And up the sun was mounting with those stars<br>That with him were, what time the Love Divine</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">At first in motion set those beauteous things;<br>So were to me occasion of good hope,<br>The variegated skin of that wild beast,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The hour of time, and the delicious season;<br>But not so much, that did not give me fear<br>A lion’s aspect which appeared to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He seemed as if against me he were coming<br>With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,<br>So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings<br>Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,<br>And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She brought upon me so much heaviness,<br>With the affright that from her aspect came,<br>That I the hope relinquished of the height.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And as he is who willingly acquires,<br>And the time comes that causes him to lose,<br>Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">E’en such made me that beast withouten peace,<br>Which, coming on against me by degrees<br>Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">While I was rushing downward to the lowland,<br>Before mine eyes did one present himself,<br>Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I beheld him in the desert vast,<br>“Have pity on me,” unto him I cried,<br>“Whiche’er thou art, or shade or real man!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He answered me: “Not man; man once I was,<br>And both my parents were of Lombardy,<br>And Mantuans by country both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Sub Julio</em> was I born, though it was late,<br>And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,<br>During the time of false and Iying gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A poet was I, and I sang that just<br>Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,<br>After that Ilion the superb was burned</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?<br>Why climb’st thou not the Mount Delectable<br>Which is the source and cause of every joy?”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain<br>Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?”<br>I made response to him with bashful forehead.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“O, of the other poets honour and light,<br>Avail me the long study and great love<br>That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thou art my master, and my author thou,<br>Thou art alone the one from whom I took<br>The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;<br>Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,<br>For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Thee it behoves to take another road,”<br>Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,<br>“If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Because this beast, at which thou criest out,<br>Suffers not any one to pass her way,<br>But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And has a nature so malign and ruthless,<br>That never doth she glut her greedy will,<br>And after food is hungrier than before.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Many the animals with whom she weds,<br>And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound<br>Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,<br>But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;<br>‘Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,<br>On whose account the maid Camilla died,<br>Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Through every city shall he hunt her down,<br>Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,<br>There from whence envy first did let her loose.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Therefore I think and judge it for thy best<br>Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,<br>And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,<br>Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<br>Who cry out each one for the second death;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And thou shalt see those who contented are<br>Within the fire, because they hope to come,<br>Whene’er it may be, to the blessed people;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,<br>A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<br>With her at my departure I will leave thee;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Because that Emperor, who reigns above,<br>In that I was rebellious to his law,<br>Wills that through me none come into his city.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He governs everywhere and there he reigns;<br>There is his city and his lofty throne;<br>O happy he whom thereto he elects!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And I to him: “Poet, I thee entreat,<br>By that same God whom thou didst never know,<br>So that I may escape this woe and worse,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,<br>That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,<br>And those thou makest so disconsolate.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Canto 2</h2>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div>
<p>DAY was departing, and the embrowned air<br>Released the animals that are on earth<br>From their fatigues; and I the only one</p>
<p>Made myself ready to sustain the war,<br>Both of the way and likewise of the woe,<br>Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</p>
<p>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me !<br>O memory, that didst write down what I saw,<br>Here thy nobility shall be manifest !</p>
<p>And I began: “Poet, who guidest me,<br>Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient.<br>Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</p>
<p>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,<br>While yet corruptible, unto the world<br>Immortal went, and was there bodily.</p>
<p>But if the adversary of all evil<br>Was courteous, thinking of the high effect<br>That issue would from him, and who, and what,</p>
<p>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;<br>For he was of great Rome, and of her empire<br>In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</p>
<p>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,<br>Were stablished as the holy place, wherein<br>Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</p>
<p>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,<br>Things did he hear, which the occasion were<br>Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</p>
<p>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,<br>To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,<br>Which of salvation’s way is the beginning.</p>
<p>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it ?<br>I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,<br>Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,<br>I fear the coming may be ill—advised;<br>Thou’rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.”</p>
<p>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,<br>And by new thoughts doth his intention change,<br>So that from his design he quite withdraws,</p>
<p>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,<br>Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,<br>Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</p>
<p>“If I have well thy language understood,”<br>Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,<br>“Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</p>
<p>Which many times a man encumbers so,<br>It turns him back from honoured enterprise,<br>As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</p>
<p>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,<br>I’ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard<br>At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</p>
<p>Among those was I who are in suspense,<br>And a fair, saintly Lady called to me<br>In such wise, I besought her to command me.</p>
<p>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;<br>And she began to say, gentle and low,<br>With voice angelical, in her own language</p>
<p>‘ O spirit courteous of Mantua,<br>Of whom the fame still in the world endures,<br>And shall endure, long—lasting as the world;</p>
<p>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,<br>Upon the desert slope is so impeded<br>Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</p>
<p>And may, I fear, already be so lost,<br>That I too late have risen to his succour,<br>From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</p>
<p>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,<br>And with what needful is for his release,<br>Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</p>
<p>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;<br>I come from there, where I would fain return;<br>Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</p>
<p>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,<br>Full often will I praise thee unto him.’<br>Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</p>
<p>‘ O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom<br>The human race exceedeth all contained<br>Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,</p>
<p>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,<br>To obey, if ’twere already done, were late;<br>No farther need’st thou ope to me thy wish.</p>
<p>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun<br>The here descending down into this centre,<br>From the vast place thou burnest to return to.’</p>
<p>‘ Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,<br>Briefly will I relate,’ she answered me,<br>‘ Why I am not afraid to enter here.</p>
<p>Of those things only should one be afraid<br>Which have the power of doing others harm;<br>Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</p>
<p>God in his mercy such created me<br>That misery of yours attains me not,<br>Nor any flame assails me of this burning</p>
<p>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves<br>At this impediment, to which I send thee,<br>So that stern judgment there above is broken.</p>
<p>In her entreaty she besought Luci´a,<br>And said, “Thy faithful one now stands in need<br>Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.”</p>
<p>Luci´a, foe of all that cruel is,<br>Hastened away, and came unto the place<br>Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</p>
<p>“Beatrice” said she, “the true praise of God,<br>Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,<br>For thee he issued from the vulgar herd ?</p>
<p>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint ?<br>Dost thou not see the death that combats him<br>Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?”</p>
<p>Never were persons in the world so swift<br>To work their weal and to escape their woe,<br>As I, after such words as these were uttered,</p>
<p>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,<br>Confiding in thy dignified discourse,<br>Which honours thee, and those who’ve listened to it.’</p>
<p>After she thus had spoken unto me,<br>Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;<br>Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</p>
<p>And unto thee I came, as she desired;<br>I have delivered thee from that wild beast,<br>Which barred the beautiful mountain’s short ascent.</p>
<p>What is it, then ? Why, why dost thou delay?<br>Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?<br>Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</p>
<p>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight<br>Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,<br>And so much good my speech doth promise thee ?”</p>
<p>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,<br>Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,<br>Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</p>
<p>Such I became with my exhausted strength,<br>And such good courage to my heart there coursed,<br>That I began, like an intrepid person:</p>
<p>“O she compassionate, who succoured me,<br>And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon<br>The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</p>
<p>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed<br>To the adventure, with these words of thine,<br>That to my first intent I have returned.</p>
<p>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,<br>Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.”<br>Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</p>
<p>I entered on the deep and savage way.</p>
<h2>Canto 3</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div>
<p>THROUGH me the way is to the city dolent;<br>Through me the way is to eternal dole;<br>Through me the way among the people lost.</p>
<p>Justice incited my sublime Creator;<br>Created me divine Omnipotence,<br>The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.</p>
<p>Before me there were no created things,’03<br>Only eterne, and I eternal last.<br>All hope abandon, ye who enter in !”</p>
<p>These words in sombre colour I beheld<br>Written upon the summit of a gate;<br>Whence I: “Their sense is, Master, hard to me!”</p>
<p>And he to me, as one experienced:<br>“Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,<br>All cowardice must needs be here extinct.</p>
<p>We to the place have come, where I have told thee<br>Thou shalt behold the people dolorous<br>Who have foregone the good of intellect.”</p>
<p>And after he had laid his hand on mine<br>With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,<br>He led me in among the secret things.</p>
<p>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud<br>Resounded through the air without a star,<br>Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</p>
<p>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,<br>Accents of anger, words of agony,<br>And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</p>
<p>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on<br>For ever in that air for ever black,<br>Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</p>
<p>And I, who had my head with horror bound,<br>Said: “Master, what is this which now I hear ?<br>What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished ?”</p>
<p>And he to me: “This miserable mode<br>Maintain the melancholy souls of those<br>Who lived withouten infamy or praise.</p>
<p>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir<br>Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,<br>Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.</p>
<p>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;<br>Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,<br>For glory none the damned would have from them.”</p>
<p>And I: “O Master, what so grievous is<br>To these, that maketh them lament so sore ?”<br>He answered: “I will tell thee very briefly.</p>
<p>These have no longer any hope of death;<br>And this blind life of theirs is so debased,<br>They envious are of every other fate.</p>
<p>No fame of them the world permits to be;<br>Misericord and Justice both disdain them.<br>Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.”</p>
<p>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,<br>Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,<br>That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</p>
<p>And after it there came so long a train<br>Of people, that I ne’er would have believed<br>That ever Death so many had undone.</p>
<p>When some among them I had recognised.<br>I looked, and I beheld the shade of him<br>Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</p>
<p>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,<br>That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches<br>Hateful to God and to his enemies.</p>
<p>These miscreants, who never were alive,<br>Were naked, and were stung exceedingly<br>By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</p>
<p>These did their faces irrigate with blood,<br>Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet<br>By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</p>
<p>And when to gazing farther I betook me.<br>People I saw on a great river’s bank;<br>Whence said I: “Master, now vouchsafe to me,</p>
<p>That I may know who these are, and what law<br>Makes them appear so ready to pass over,<br>As I discern athwart the dusky light.”</p>
<p>And he to me: “These things shall all be known<br>To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay<br>Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.”</p>
<p>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,<br>Fearing my words might irksome be to him,<br>From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</p>
<p>And lo ! towards us coming in a boat<br>An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,<br>Crying: “Woe unto you, ye souls depraved</p>
<p>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;<br>I come to lead you to the other shore,<br>To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</p>
<p>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,<br>Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!<br>But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</p>
<p>He said: “By other ways, by other ports<br>Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;<br>A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.”</p>
<p>And unto him the Guide: “Vex thee not, Charon;<br>It is so willed there where is power to do<br>That which is willed; and farther question not.”</p>
<p>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks<br>Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,<br>Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</p>
<p>But all those souls who weary were and naked<br>Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,<br>As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</p>
<p>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,<br>The human race, the place, the time, the seed<br>Of their engendering and of their birth !</p>
<p>Thereafter all together they drew back,<br>Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,<br>Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</p>
<p>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,<br>Beckoning to them, collects them all together,<br>Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</p>
<p>As in the autumn—time the leaves fall off,<br>First one and then another, till the branch<br>Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</p>
<p>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam<br>Throw themselves from that margin one by one,<br>At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</p>
<p>So they depart across the dusky wave,<br>And ere upon the other side they land,<br>Again on this side a new troop assembles.</p>
<p>“My son,” the courteous Master said to me,<br>“All those who perish in the wrath of God<br>Here meet together out of every land;</p>
<p>And ready are they to pass o’er the river,<br>Because celestial Justice spurs them on,<br>So that their fear is turned into desire.</p>
<p>This way there never passes a good soul;<br>And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,<br>Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.”</p>
<p>This being finished, all the dusk champaign<br>Trembled so violently, that of that terror<br>The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</p>
<p>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,<br>And fulminated a vermilion light,<br>Which overmastered in me every sense,</p>
<p>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</p>
<h2>Canto 4</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>The heavy sleep within my head was smashed<br>by an enormous thunderclap, so that<br>I started up as one whom force awakens;</p>
<p>I stood erect and turned my rested eyes<br>from side to side, and I stared steadily<br>to learn what place it was surrounding me.</p>
<p>In truth I found myself upon the brink<br>of an abyss, the melancholy valley<br>containing thundering, unending wailings.</p>
<p>That valley, dark and deep and filled with mist,<br>is such that, though I gazed into its pit,<br>I was unable to discern a thing.</p>
<p>“Let us descend into the blind world now,”<br>the poet, who was deathly pale, began;<br>“I shall go first and you will follow me.”</p>
<p>But I, who’d seen the change in his complexion,<br>said: “How shall I go on if you are frightened,<br>you who have always helped dispel my doubts?”</p>
<p>And he to me: “The anguish of the people<br>whose place is here below, has touched my face<br>with the compassion you mistake for fear.</p>
<p>Let us go on, the way that waits is long.”<br>So he set out, and so he had me enter<br>on that first circle girdling the abyss.</p>
<p>Here, for as much as hearing could discover,<br>there was no outcry louder than the sighs<br>that caused the everlasting air to tremble.</p>
<p>The sighs arose from sorrow without torments,<br>out of the crowds—the many multitudes—<br>of infants and of women and of men.</p>
<p>The kindly master said: “Do you not ask<br>who are these spirits whom you see before you?<br>I’d have you know, before you go ahead,</p>
<p>they did not sin; and yet, though they have merits,<br>that’s not enough, because they lacked baptism,<br>the portal of the faith that you embrace.</p>
<p>And if they lived before Christianity,<br>they did not worship God in fitting ways;<br>and of such spirits I myself am one.</p>
<p>For these defects, and for no other evil,<br>we now are lost and punished just with this:<br>we have no hope and yet we live in longing.”</p>
<p>Great sorrow seized my heart on hearing him,<br>for I had seen some estimable men<br>among the souls suspended in that limbo.</p>
<p>“Tell me, my master, tell me, lord.” I then<br>began because I wanted to be certain<br>of that belief which vanquishes all errors,</p>
<p>“did any ever go—by his own merit<br>or others’—from this place toward blessedness?”<br>And he, who understood my covert speech,</p>
<p>replied: “I was new—entered on this state<br>when I beheld a Great Lord enter here;<br>the crown he wore, a sign of victory.</p>
<p>He carried off the shade of our first father,<br>of his son Abel, and the shade of Noah,<br>of Moses, the obedient legislator,</p>
<p>of father Abraham, David the king,<br>of Israel, his father, and his sons,<br>and Rachel, she for whom he worked so long,</p>
<p>and many others—and He made them blessed;<br>and I should have you know that, before them,<br>there were no human souls that had been saved.”</p>
<p>We did not stay our steps although he spoke;<br>we still continued onward through the wood—<br>the wood, I say, where many spirits thronged.</p>
<p>Our path had not gone far beyond the point<br>where I had slept, when I beheld a fire<br>win out against a hemisphere of shadows.</p>
<p>We still were at a little distance from it,<br>but not so far I could not see in part<br>that honorable men possessed that place.</p>
<p>“O you who honor art and science both,<br>who are these souls whose dignity has kept<br>their way of being, separate from the rest?”</p>
<p>And he to me: “The honor of their name,<br>which echoes up above within your life,<br>gains Heaven’s grace, and that advances them.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was a voice that I could hear:<br>“Pay honor to the estimable poet;<br>his shadow, which had left us, now returns.”</p>
<p>After that voice was done, when there was silence,<br>I saw four giant shades approaching us;<br>in aspect, they were neither sad nor joyous.</p>
<p>My kindly master then began by saying:<br>“Look well at him who holds that sword in hand<br>who moves before the other three as lord.</p>
<p>That shade is Homer, the consummate poet;<br>the other one is Horace, satirist;<br>the third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</p>
<p>Because each of these spirits shares with me<br>the name called out before by the lone voice,<br>they welcome me—and, doing that, do well.”</p>
<p>And so I saw that splendid school assembled<br>led by the lord of song incomparable,<br>who like an eagle soars above the rest.</p>
<p>Soon after they had talked a while together,<br>they turned to me, saluting cordially;<br>and having witnessed this, my master smiled;</p>
<p>and even greater honor then was mine,<br>for they invited me to join their ranks—<br>I was the sixth among such intellects.</p>
<p>So did we move along and toward the light,<br>talking of things about which silence here<br>is just as seemly as our speech was there.</p>
<p>We reached the base of an exalted castle,<br>encircled seven times by towering walls,<br>defended all around by a fair stream.</p>
<p>We forded this as if upon hard ground;<br>I entered seven portals with these sages;<br>we reached a meadow of green flowering plants.</p>
<p>The people here had eyes both grave and slow;<br>their features carried great authority;<br>they spoke infrequently, with gentle voices.</p>
<p>We drew aside to one part of the meadow,<br>an open place both high and filled with light,<br>and we could see all those who were assembled.</p>
<p>Facing me there, on the enameled green,<br>great—hearted souls were shown to me and I<br>still glory in my having witnessed them.</p>
<p>I saw Electra with her many comrades,<br>among whom I knew Hector and Aeneas,<br>and Caesar, in his armor, falcon-eyed.</p>
<p>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea<br>and, on the other side, saw King Latinus,<br>who sat beside Lavinia, his daughter.</p>
<p>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin out,<br>Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,<br>and, solitary, set apart, Saladin.</p>
<p>When I had raised my eyes a little higher,<br>I saw the master of the men who know<br>seated in philosophic family.</p>
<p>There all look up to him, all do him honor:<br>there I beheld both Socrates and Plato,<br>closest to him, in front of all the rest;</p>
<p>Democritus, who ascribes the world to chance,<br>Diogenes, Empedocles, and Zeno,<br>and Thales, Anaxagoras, Heraclitus;</p>
<p>I saw the good collector of medicinals,<br>I mean Dioscorides; and I saw Orpheus,<br>and Tully, Linus, moral Seneca;</p>
<p>and Euclid the geometer, and Ptolemy,<br>Hippocrates and Galen, Avicenna,<br>Averroes, of the great Commentary.</p>
<p>I cannot here describe them all in full;<br>my ample theme impels me onward so:<br>what’s told is often less than the event.</p>
<p>The company of six divides in two;<br>my knowing guide leads me another way,<br>beyond the quiet, into trembling air.</p>
<p>And I have reached a part where no thing gleams.</p>
<h2>Canto 5</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align: center;">So I descended from the first enclosure<br>down to the second circle, that which girdles<br>less space but grief more great, that goads to weeping.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There dreadful Minos stands, gnashing his teeth:<br>examining the sins of those who enter,<br>he judges and assigns as his tail twines.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I mean that when the spirit born to evil<br>appears before him, it confesses all;<br>and he, the connoisseur of sin, can tell</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">the depth in Hell appropriate to it;<br>as many times as Minos wraps his tail<br>around himself, that marks the sinner’s level.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Always there is a crowd that stands before him:<br>each soul in turn advances toward that judgment;<br>they speak and hear, then they are cast below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Arresting his extraordinary task,<br>Minos, as soon as he had seen me, said:<br>“O you who reach this house of suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">be careful how you enter, whom you trust;<br>the gate is wide, but do not be deceived!”<br>To which my guide replied: “But why protest?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Do not attempt to block his fated path:<br>our passage has been willed above, where One<br>can do what He has willed; and ask no more.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Now notes of desperation have begun<br>to overtake my hearing; now I come<br>where mighty lamentation beats against me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I reached a place where every light is muted,<br>which bellows like the sea beneath a tempest,<br>when it is battered by opposing winds.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The hellish hurricane, which never rests,<br>drives on the spirits with its violence:<br>wheeling and pounding, it harasses them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When they come up against the ruined slope,<br>then there are cries and wailing and lament,<br>and there they curse the force of the divine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I learned that those who undergo this torment<br>are damned because they sinned within the flesh,<br>subjecting reason to the rule of lust.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And as, in the cold season, starlings’ wings<br>bear them along in broad and crowded ranks<br>so does that blast bear on the guilty spirits:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">now here, now there, now down, now up, it drives them.<br>There is no hope that ever comforts them—<br>no hope for rest and none for lesser pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And just as cranes in flight will chant their lays,<br>arraying their long file across the air,<br>so did the shades I saw approaching, borne</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">by that assailing wind, lament and moan;<br>so that I asked him: “Master, who are those<br>who suffer punishment in this dark air?”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“The first of those about whose history<br>you want to know,” my master then told me<br>“once ruled as empress over many nations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Her vice of lust became so customary<br>that she made license licit in her laws<br>to free her from the scandal she had caused.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She is Semiramis, of whom we read<br>that she was Ninus’ wife and his successor:<br>she held the land the Sultan now commands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">That other spirit killed herself for love,<br>and she betrayed the ashes of Sychaeus;<br>the wanton Cleopatra follows next.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">See Helen, for whose sake so many years<br>of evil had to pass; see great Achilles,<br>who finally met love-in his last battle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">See Paris, Tristan . . .”—and he pointed out<br>and named to me more than a thousand shades<br>departed from our life because of love.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No sooner had I heard my teacher name<br>the ancient ladies and the knights, than pity<br>seized me, and I was like a man astray.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My first words: “Poet, I should willingly<br>speak with those two who go together there<br>and seem so lightly carried by the wind.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And he to me: “You’ll see when they draw closer<br>to us, and then you may appeal to them<br>by that love which impels them. They will come.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No sooner had the wind bent them toward us<br>than I urged on my voice: “O battered souls<br>if One does not forbid it, speak with us.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Even as doves when summoned by desire,<br>borne forward by their will, move through the air<br>with wings uplifted, still, to their sweet nest,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">those spirits left the ranks where Dido suffers<br>approaching us through the malignant air;<br>so powerful had been my loving cry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“O living being, gracious and benign,<br>who through the darkened air have come to visit<br>our souls that stained the world with blood, if He</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">who rules the universe were friend to us<br>then we should pray to Him to give you peace<br>for you have pitied our atrocious state.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Whatever pleases you to hear and speak<br>will please us, too, to hear and speak with you,<br>now while the wind is silent, in this place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The land where I was born lies on that shore<br>to which the Po together with the waters<br>that follow it descends to final rest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Love, that can quickly seize the gentle heart,<br>took hold of him because of the fair body<br>taken from me—how that was done still wounds me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Love, that releases no beloved from loving,<br>took hold of me so strongly through his beauty<br>that, as you see, it has not left me yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Love led the two of us unto one death.<br>Caina waits for him who took our life.”<br>These words were borne across from them to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I had listened to those injured souls,<br>I bent my head and held it low until<br>the poet asked of me: “What are you thinking?”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I replied, my words began: “Alas,<br>how many gentle thoughts, how deep a longing,<br>had led them to the agonizing pass!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Then I addressed my speech again to them,<br>and I began: “Francesca, your afflictions<br>move me to tears of sorrow and of pity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But tell me, in the time of gentle sighs,<br>with what and in what way did Love allow you<br>to recognize your still uncertain longings?”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And she to me: “There is no greater sorrow<br>than thinking back upon a happy time<br>in misery—and this your teacher knows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Yet if you long so much to understand<br>the first root of our love, then I shall tell<br>my tale to you as one who weeps and speaks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">One day, to pass the time away, we read<br>of Lancelot—how love had overcome him.<br>We were alone, and we suspected nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And time and time again that reading led<br>our eyes to meet, and made our faces pale,<br>and yet one point alone defeated us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When we had read how the desired smile<br>was kissed by one who was so true a lover,<br>this one, who never shall be parted from me,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">while all his body trembled, kissed my mouth.<br>A Gallehault indeed, that book and he<br>who wrote it, too; that day we read no more.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And while one spirit said these words to me,<br>the other wept, so that—because of pity—<br>I fainted, as if I had met my death.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And then I fell as a dead body falls.</p>
