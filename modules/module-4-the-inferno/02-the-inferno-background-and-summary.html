                <h1>The Inferno</h1>
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
                <p>Dante and Virgil</p>
                <p>Dante Alighieri, the author of <em>The Divine Comedy</em>, was born in Florence, a northern Italian
                    city-state that was central to his political and spiritual stance. Around 1300 C.E., Florence, like
                    many Italian city-states, was caught in a large-scale confrontation between those who thought the
                    Papacy and the church should possess absolute power and those who thought that the city-state should
                    be independent of the Papacy. Alighieri wrote about this conflict in <em>The
                        Monarch</em><em>ia</em>, which was promptly banned for seeking to place limitations on the
                    political power of the church. This ban was not lifted until 1881.</p>
                <p>These two parties were referred to as the Guelphs (who supported the Pope) and the Ghibellines (who
                    supported the Holy Roman Emperor). Unfortunately for Dante, the Guelphs became dominant within the
                    city of Florence. There was, however, a schism in the Guelph party: The Black Guelphs continued to
                    support Pope Boniface VIII, and the White Guelphs had come to despise his despotism. Naturally,
                    Dante sided with the White Guelphs. However, while he was in Rome, the Black Guelphs seized power of
                    Florence and banned Alighieri from reentering Florence in pain of being burned at stake. This
                    sentence was not revoked until 2008, and Alighieri was never able to return home. </p>
                <p><em>The</em> <em>Divine Comedy</em><em> </em>is made up of one hundred <strong>cantos</strong>, which
                    are divided into three sections of thirty-three. The extra canto is the introductory canto at the
                    beginning of <em>The Inferno</em>. This numerological structure is reflected in the landscape as
                    well: Hell is divided into nine circles, each containing a different category of a sinner, each with
                    its unique punishment. The constant play on the number three and its cube (3x3) highlights the
                    Trinitarian theology underlying the structure of the entire <em>Comedy</em>.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
                <p>Layers of Hell</p>
                <p>Our story begins with just Virgil, the guide, and Dante as they begin at the gates of Hell inscribed
                    with, “Abandon all hope ye who enter here.”</p>
                <p>They pass the gate and enter what is called ante-Inferno, which is before “we” reach what is called
                    the layers of Hell. This area is designed for people who have had the choice between good and evil
                    and could not choose, so they have been rejected by both Heaven and Hell. These prisoners are
                    constantly tormented and chased by hornets and snakes, forcing them into action. There are Angels
                    here as well, those that chose neither side in the war of good versus evil. They are also tormented.
                </p>
                <p>Virgil and Dante come to a great River, which serves as the boundary of Hell and where many souls
                    wait for a boat ride from Charon, who appears in Greek mythology on the River into Hades. You will
                    notice a lot of Greek and Roman mythology seeping into this poem as we go on. Charon crosses with
                    the duo, and we encounter the first real circle of Hell. This circle is called Limbo. The souls here
                    are “virtuous pagans.” They have done great deeds, lived morally good lives, but either did not
                    accept Christianity, lived long before it existed, or were never baptized. God granted passage of a
                    few figures such as Noah and Moses to enter Heaven, but it is phrased as a rare occurrence. This is
                    where Virgil, other poets, and philosophers exist, so that Virgil will return here after their
                    adventure. There is no physical punishment but rather a general sadness that they are so close to
                    Heaven but forever kept outside.</p>
                <p>The second circle of Hell they approach houses those guilty of lust. These are those that gave in to
                    pleasure and are now cursed with eternity amid a raging storm wind; it is strong enough to whip some
                    about uncontrollably, ravaging them against the rocks.</p>
                <p>The third circle of Hell continues to rain, but now it is filth raining from the sky, and those that
                    were gluttonous and consumed in excess lay on the ground unable to move, forever pelted with debris
                    and sewage. In this level, Dante also sees the monster Cerberus prowling. In Greek mythology,
                    Cerberus is the three-headed dog that keeps souls in Hades. Interestingly, Dante continues to mix
                    mythology and religion here.</p>
                <p>Like those that were gluttonous, the fourth circle is dedicated to those who suffered the sin of
                    greed. Here we find a demon named Plutus, who in Greek mythology was the God of money and wealth.
                    The greedy are forever battling each other, rolling giant boulders into each other in a constant
                    jousting match. There is no reprieve from the battle.</p>
                <p>The fifth circle is against a giant river, the River Styx, where the wrathful and angry are kept
                    fighting each other forever, clawing and biting in anger. The sullen and gloomy are also kept here,
                    submerged under the water and forced to breathe and choked on the black mud.</p>
                <p>Withdrawing further from the world, Virgil and Dante cross the River and approach the lower half: the
                    worst of the worst. There is a city here, and it is guarded by fallen Angels, who turn Virgil and
                    Dante away: “No living man may enter Dis!” the fallen angels’ shout. This is the first place where
                    Virgil holds no sway or influence and may not be able to protect Dante. However, a messenger from
                    Heaven arrives and tells these Angels that they should open the gates, and they reluctantly obey.
                </p>
                <p>Virgil and Dante enter the sixth circle of Hell. They find themselves walking into a graveyard with
                    tombstones covered in flames: here lie the heretics, or those who promoted other false religions, or
                    the rejection of religious and political “norms.”</p>
                <p>The Seventh Circle is home to violence, and there are three rings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The outer ring</strong> is for those who are violent to others, like murderers and
                        warlords.</li>
                    <li><strong>The middle ring</strong> is for those who are violent to themselves, committing acts of
                        suicide.</li>
                    <li><strong>The inner ring</strong> is for those that are violent against God, such as blasphemers
                        against God and violence against nature and God's creation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Virgil and Dante meet and ask a creature named Geryon to take them to the 8th circle of Hell. This
                    beast is a symbol of fraud, as he is the face of a man who tricks you while he stings you with his
                    scorpion tail. In this story, he has massive wings and flies our heroes to the next level, which is
                    for fraud itself. Within the eighth circle is another called the Malebolge (“Evil Pockets”), which
                    houses ten separate bolgias (“ditches”), with demons torturing people all around those that have
                    deceived and manipulated others during their life; this includes pimps and sexual manipulators, as
                    well as gamblers and people who created false money. We also have fortunetellers with their heads
                    placed backward, so they can only see behind them. These punishments are terrifying yet apt to their
                    crimes.</p>
                <p>In the final circle of Hell, we have Satan himself: a giant 3 headed beast that is forever flapping
                    his giant wings. Contrary to popular belief, this level of Hell is frozen, and most of Satan’s body
                    is encased in ice. He is forever punishing the three greatest betrayers in history: Judas, who
                    betrayed Jesus Christ, and Brutus and Cassius, who betrayed Julius Caesar. There are other men
                    wholly frozen in ice, those that have betrayed their family, their God, or their country. As an
                    author, Dante makes some sharp criticism in these last few circles, including referencing political
                    parties and real people. They all exist in the deepest bowels of Hell for what they (maybe) did.
                    Virgil grabs Dante and they climb down Satan’s frozen body until they end up at his feet, which is
                    now somehow turned upside down. Down has become up.</p>
