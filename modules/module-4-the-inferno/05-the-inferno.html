<p>If we are reading The Inferno as an allegory for psychological health, then a few key images deserve analysis and, perhaps, an intellectual reckoning for each of us. As Dante first finds himself the dark wood:</p>
<p>Midway upon the journey of our life<br />I found myself within a forest dark,<br />For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</p>
<p>Note, first the "our"; this is the first indication that this text is <b>not</b> meant to be read as a text <b>for and about Dante alone</b>. Likewise, once that straightforward had been lost, Dante could clearly see the way out, yet he was barred. The crux of this response centers around this confrontation: first the leopard, then the lion, and finally the she-wolf. <b>Each of these animals represents something else, a specific type of sin</b>. It is, however, the she-wolf that garners this response from Dante:</p>
<p>She brought upon me so much heaviness,<br />With the affright that from her aspect came,<br />That I the hope relinquished of the height.</p>
<p>This video, based upon Sheila Marie Orfano&rsquo;s lesson, explores some of the main concepts of The Paradiso:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YbCEWSip9pQ?wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>We can also infer from Dante&rsquo;s reactions to figures such a Francesca Da Rimini, specifically punctuated by the moments when Dante shows empathy and pity, and he is overwhelmed to the point of fainting. These levels of hell correspond to the She-Wolf, sins of incontinence, the very sins Dante pities. It is a form of self-pity; yet, by the end of the poem, in the final circle, we find Dante kicking the head of a man; It may surprise us to know the punishment is moral, and the pity is not.</p>
<p>In the video, they reference that The Paradiso is one of redemption. Why do you think part of that redemption involves an absence of pity, and, <b>more specifically, how does this mean Dante, and we, need to treat ourselves</b>?</p>
