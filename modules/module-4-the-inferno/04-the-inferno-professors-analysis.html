                <h3>Reading The Inferno Differently</h3>
                <p>For the sake of this course, we are going to read <em>The Inferno</em> differently: <strong>as a
                        personal account of a universal journey.</strong></p>

                <p>This, of course, begs the question: what kind of journey? While the theological connection to
                    Christianity is obvious, <em>The Inferno</em>, especially in consideration of the entire <em>Divine
                        Comedy</em>, can be read as a guide to manifest a healthy, psychologically balanced mind.</p>

                <h3>Trajectory and Geometry</h3>
                <p>First, we need to talk a little about trajectory and geometry. Wait, is this not a literature course?
                    I get it, but let me explain. First, a <strong>comedy</strong>, in the Greek sense, does not mean
                    "something that makes us laugh." What it does explain is the trajectory of the story:</p>

                <div class="callout-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f8f9fa 0%, #e9ecef 100%); border-left: 4px solid #6c5ce7; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>The Comedy's Trajectory:</strong> A comedy moves from a place of
                        conflict (like waking up in Hell) to a place of fulfillment (like arriving in Heaven). In a
                        sense, we can call a comedy a story with a "happy" outcome.</p>
                </div>

                <p>In Dante's understanding of geometry, the <strong>human trajectory</strong>, or the direction in
                    which we move, is <em>linear</em>. It may help to think of how we experience time to understand
                    Dante's point: we are born, we make decisions, and we are held accountable for those decisions.</p>

                <p><strong>Angels</strong>, however, always move in a <em>circular trajectory</em> because they exist
                    outside of time; this can be seen both in the movement of the fallen angels throughout the text
                    (constantly circling) and the punishment of Satan. When we consider these two trajectories together,
                    both linear and circular, we are presented with the physical structure of hell itself: <strong>a
                        spiral, funneling to the point of contention.</strong></p>

                <h3>Thomas Aquinas's Four Levels of Reading</h3>
                <p>Second, we also need to understand how this text was meant to be understood from a theological
                    perspective. According to Thomas Aquinas, there are four ways that every theological text (in the
                    Christian tradition) must be read:</p>

                <dl style="background: #fafafa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <dt><strong>1. Historically or Literally</strong></dt>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">E.g., Moses' exodus from Egypt in the Bible.
                        This is considered a historical event where the Jewish people were removed from bondage on a
                        literal level.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>2. Allegorically</strong></dt>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">E.g., Moses' exodus is also understood as an
                        allegory for how Christ will lead humanity out of "moral" bondage.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>3. Morally or Tropological (in the now)</strong></dt>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">E.g., Moses' exodus, mirrored in Christ's
                        promise, is meant to be applied to the reader of the Bible at the moment: they are supposed to
                        exit their moral bondage through personal choice.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>4. Anagogical</strong></dt>
                    <dd style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 0;">E.g., Moses' exodus is also mirrored in
                        revelations, as "all humanity" is removed from the bondage of this plane of existence and enters
                        the "promised" land.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>Thus, with one story (Moses' exodus from Egypt), the audience is presented with four ways of
                    understanding that story. <strong>Dante expects the same of us as we read the <em>Divine
                            Comedy</em>.</strong></p>

                <p>In this way, if we read <em>The Inferno</em> with the theological framework Aquinas had in mind,
                    every reading of the text, aside from the historical, not only can but <em>should</em> be applied to
                    the reader, both in the present and in the future.</p>

                <h3>Historical Context</h3>
                <p>While we are on the subject of reading the text historically, however, we should clear a few things
                    up: due to the inclusion of Dante's "political enemies," some critics view <em>The Inferno</em> as a
                    pseudo fan fiction, where Dante punishes those he disagrees with.</p>

                <p>Also, like a few of the texts we are going to study this semester, Dante made a radical choice in his
                    choice of composition: <strong>he wrote the <em>Divine Comedy</em> in the "common" language of the
                        time (Italian) rather than the "educated" language (Latin).</strong></p>

                <p><em>Why is that a big deal?</em></p>

                <p>Well, most people did not know how to read Latin! Those that could were not common people, and
                    considered Latin to be the only viable language for those properly educated. So, if the "people" had
                    no understanding of Latin, and all literature of the time had been recorded in Latin, could the
                    "common" person understand all those literary references we do, e.g., Tristan and Isolde, or
                    Achilles, Paris, and Helen (we will meet them soon)? Naturally, the answer is no. They would,
                    however, understand all those current political references.</p>

                <p>It is always important to remember the audience. Furthermore, it is imperative for the logic of
                    <em>The Inferno</em> that whoever is reading can understand the inferences because Dante uses
                    <strong>"Type to Anti-type"</strong> and <strong>"Figure Fulfillment"</strong> to build his
                    allegory. The only real difference here between figure fulfillment and the Anti-Type is one of time
                    and direction. The story of Isaac and Abraham is a biblical story that demonstrates figure
                    fulfillment, as the sacrifice of his son would mirror and foreshadow God's sacrifice of his son in
                    the future, whereas Pope Celestine V is the Anti-Type for all cowards that preceded him.
                </p>

                <h3>The Will and Syndesis</h3>
                <p>Now that all the complicated background is out of the way, let me outline what this work is about:
                    <strong>the will</strong>. More specifically, Dante's journey is about the weakness of the will and
                    how to obtain <em>syndesis</em> between the will and reason. To put it simply:
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3cd 0%, #ffeeba 100%); border: 2px solid #856404; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; margin: 0; color: #856404;">Does having, knowing, or
                        understanding the definition of justice make you just?</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #856404;"><em>If not, then it is a problem of the will.</em>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #d4edda 0%, #c3e6cb 100%); border-left: 4px solid #28a745; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Syndesis</strong> is concerned with one's reason and one's will being
                        joined: that what one <em>says</em> is the right thing (adultery is a sin), and what one
                        <em>does</em> (not committing adultery for any reason) are the same.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>It is also worth noting that, through the geometry discussed above, it is also apparent that Dante
                    based the structure of Hell on a common practice at the time: <strong>Labyrinthian
                        meditation</strong>. Author DeAnna Evans puts it this way:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">"Just as Theseus, without the guidance of Ariadne's thread, would have been
                        entangled in the labyrinth at Crete, hopelessly lost, facing certain death, so Christians would
                        become entrapped and lost in this world, unable to attain salvation, without the divine grace
                        extended by Christ. This grace was the thread by means of which the faithful negotiated their
                        way through a sinful, perilous world, ultimately triumphed over evil, and reached Paradise,
                        symbolized by the defeat of the Minotaur in the myth and by reaching the centers of the church
                        labyrinths."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <div class="conclusion-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e2e3e5 0%, #d6d8db 100%); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">
                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 0;"><strong><em>The Inferno</em> is a labyrinth of the mind; it
                            is a labyrinth in which we are meant to confront the gap between our reason and our will and
                            achieve syndesis.</strong></p>
