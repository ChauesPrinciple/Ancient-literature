<h2>The Inferno Analysis</h2>

<p>Satan in Hell</p>
<p>For the sake of this course, we are going to read The Inferno differently:</p>
<p>as a personal account of a universal journey.</p>
<p>This, of course, begs the question: what kind of journey? While the theological connection to Christianity is obvious, The Inferno, especially in consideration of the entire Divine Comedy, can be read as a guide to manifest a healthy, psychologically balanced mind.</p>
<p>First, we need to talk a little about trajectory and geometry. Wait, is this not a literature course? I get it, but let me explain. First, a comedy, in the Greek sense, does not mean “something that makes us laugh.” What it does explain is the trajectory of the story:</p>
<p>A comedy moves from a place of conflict (like waking up in Hell) to a place of fulfillment (like arriving in Heaven). In a sense, we can call a comedy a story with a “happy” outcome.</p>
<p>In Dante’s understanding of geometry, the human trajectory, or the direction in which we move, is linear. It may help to think of how we experience time to understand Dante’s point: we are born, we make decisions, and we are held accountable for those decisions.</p>
<p>Angels, however, always move in a circular trajectory because they exist outside of time; this can be seen both in the movement of the fallen angels throughout the text (constantly circling) and the punishment of Satan. When we consider these two trajectories together, both linear and circular, we are presented with the physical structure of hell itself: a spiral, funneling to the point of contention.</p>
<p>Second, we also need to understand how this text was meant to be understood from a theological perspective. According to Thomas Aquinas, there are four ways that every theological text (in the Christian tradition) must be read.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Historically or Literally</strong></dt>
<dd>E.g., Moses’ exodus from Egypt in the Bible. This is considered a historical event where the Jewish people were removed from bondage on a literal level.</dd>
<dt><strong>Allegorically</strong></dt>
<dd>E.g., Moses’ exodus is also understood as an allegory for how Christ will lead humanity out of “moral” bondage.</dd>
<dt><strong>Morally or Tropological (in the now)</strong></dt>
<dd>E.g., Moses’ exodus, mirrored in Christ’s promise, is meant to be applied to the reader of the Bible at the moment: they are supposed to exit their moral bondage through personal choice.</dd>
<dt><strong>Anagogical</strong></dt>
<dd>E.g., Moses’ exodus is also mirrored in revelations, as “all humanity” is removed from the bondage of this plane of existence and enters the “promised” land.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus, with one story (Moses’ exodus from Egypt), the audience is presented with four ways of understanding that story. Dante expects the same of us as we read the Divine Comedy.</p>
<p>In this way, if we read The Inferno with the theological framework Aquinas had in mind, every reading of the text, aside from the historical, not only can but should be applied to the reader, both in the present and in the future.</p>
<p>While we are on the subject of reading the text historically, however, we should clear a few things up: due to the inclusion of Dante's "political enemies," some critics view The Inferno as a pseudo fan fiction, where Dante punishes those he disagrees with.</p>
<p>Also, like a few of the texts we are going to study this semester, Dante made a radical choice in his choice of composition: he wrote the Divine Comedy in the “common” language of the time (Italian) rather than the “educated” language (Latin).</p>
<p>Why is that a big deal?</p>
<p>Well, most people did not know how to read Latin! Those that could be not common people, and considered Latin to be the only viable language for those properly educated. So, if the "people" had no understanding of Latin, and all literature of the time had been recorded in Latin, could the "common" person understand all those literary references we do, e.g., Tristan and Isolde, or Achilles, Paris, and Helen (we will meet them soon)? Naturally, the answer is no. They would, however, understand all those current political references. It is always important to remember the audience. Furthermore, it is imperative for the logic of The Inferno that whoever is reading can understand the inferences because Dante uses “Type to Anti-type” and “Figure Fulfillment” to build his allegory. The only real difference here between figure fulfillment and the Anti-Type is one of time and direction. The story of Isaac and Abraham is a biblical story that demonstrates figure fulfillment, as the sacrifice of his son would mirror and foreshadow God’s sacrifice of his son in the future, whereas Pope Celestine V is the Anti-Type for all cowards that preceded him. Here are some related examples:</p>
<p>Now that all the complicated background is out of the way let me outline what this work is about the will. More specifically, Dante’s journey is about the weakness of the will and how to obtain syndesis between the will and reason. To put it simply:</p>
<p>Does having, knowing, or understanding the definition of justice makes you just?</p>
<p>Then it is a problem of the will.</p>
<p>Syndesis is concerned with one’s reason and one’s will being joined: that what one says is the right thing (adultery is a sin), and what one does (not committing adultery for any reason) are the same. It is also worth noting that, through the geometry discussed above, it is also apparent that Dante based the structure of Hell on a common practice at the time: Labyrinthian meditation. Author DeAnna Evan’s puts it this way:</p>
<p>“Just as Theseus, without the guidance of Ariadne’s thread, would have been entangled in the labyrinth at Crete, hopelessly lost, facing certain death, so Christians would become entrapped and lost in this world, unable to attain salvation, without the divine grace extended by Christ. This grace was the thread by means of which the faithful negotiated their way through a sinful, perilous world, ultimately triumphed over evil, and reached Paradise, symbolized by the defeat of the Minotaur in the myth and by reaching the centers of the church labyrinths.”</p>
<p>The Inferno is a labyrinth of the mind; it is a labyrinth in which we are meant to confront the gap between our reason and our will and achieve syndesis.</p>
