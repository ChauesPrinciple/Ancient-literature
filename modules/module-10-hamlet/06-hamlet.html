<p>As we are now more than halfway through the course material, you have probably noticed a lack of stories from some continents and cultures, such as Africa and the Americas. This is partially due to the lack of free translations. Still, it is also indicative of a Western perspective that because these cultures utilized an <strong>oral tradition </strong>to record their myths and history, they had no history.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with Hamlet?</p>
<p>In the analysis for Hamlet, I asked this rhetorical question:</p>
<p>"What would happen if our "conscience" (our internal morality) and "ego ideal" (what people we respect say is moral) are in conflict?" -- Here is a primer on these terms:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRDUlxc6VDw?start=207&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The purpose of asking this question was to highlight how <strong>the conflict between the conscience and the ego-ideal</strong> <em>results</em> in diverse forms of self-punishment, the "moral masochism" Freud described in terms "the criminal from a sense of guilt," "those wrecked by success," and other self-sabotaging and self-tormenting character-types. There is, however, a nice contrast to Hamlet that comes from the Congo told by the Nyanga people called the <em>Epic of Mwindo</em>. Please watch this video explaining the Mwindo epic:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NzmFEDNWTO8?wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Within the Mwindo epic, and similar to the notion of <strong>dharma</strong> in the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, there is an emphasis on not seeking vengeance and maintaining a sense of humility even in greatness. Thus, Mwindo does not seek to kill anyone out of vengeance, and he does not wish to slay his father for his transgressions.</p>
<p>Would you please compare and contrast Hamlet's and Mwindo's responses to the "Betrayal of What is Right" within their community? Why does Hamlet suffer from a subconscious need for punishment that leads to his tragic end, and what could he learn from Mwindo?</p>
