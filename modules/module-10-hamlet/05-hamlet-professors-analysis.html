                <em>[Image Intended: The First Folio of Hamlet]</em>
            </div>
            <p>Hamlet may not seem like an obvious choice for this chapter on warriors. He is notorious for his
                inaction, right? By some, maybe, but let us dig a bit deeper into the action of the play, and whether
                Hamlet is truly as fickle as he has been accused. It is the position of this analysis that he is acting
                rationally; he is also the first model of the modern existential dilemma that we, and our soldiers,
                face.</p>
            <p>In most of our texts, we are dealing with honor-based societies. This is true for Gilgamesh, the Iliad,
                Beowulf, and the Bhagavad Gita, but distinctly not the Song of Roland or Hamlet, which fall under the
                Guilt Culture Area. In Beowulf and the Song of Roland, we see the bookending of the transitional period
                between the honor-based warrior culture and the modern guilt-based Christian society of our modern
                world. The latter being the beginning, and the former being the conclusion of this process, both of
                which mark the conversion of the Germanic societal norms. Hamlet, on the other hand, shows us the
                inherent internal conflict of the modern person: is the warrior ethos of revenge or the Christian ethos
                of forgiveness of higher-order concern?</p>
            <p>Naturally, to explore this internal conflict, we will need to define some terms of the mind, ala
                psychoanalysis:</p>
            <p>Id—instinctual drives present at birth</p>
            <p>Does not distinguish between reality and fantasy.</p>
            <p>Operates according to the pleasure principle—drive toward immediate gratification, the most fundamental
                human motive.</p>
            <p>Sources of energy:</p>
            <p>Eros—life instinct perpetuates life.</p>
            <p>Libido—sexual energy or motivation</p>
            <p>Thanatos—death instinct, aggression, self-destructive actions</p>
            <p>Ego—develops out of the id in infancy</p>
            <p>Understands reality and logic.</p>
            <p>A mediator between the id and superego</p>
            <p>The part of the personality that mediates the demands of the id without going against the restraints of
                the superego.</p>
            <p>Rational, organized, logical, and mediator to demands of reality.</p>
            <p>Reality principle—the ability to postpone gratification in accordance with demands of reality.</p>
            <p>Can repress desires that cannot be met in an acceptable manner.</p>
            <p>Superego:</p>
            <p>Internalization of societal & parental moral standards</p>
            <p>One’s conscience; focuses on what the person “should” do.</p>
            <p>Develops around ages 5-6.</p>
            <p>Partially unconscious</p>
            <p>It can be harshly punitive using feelings of guilt.</p>
            <p>The last component of personality to develop</p>
            <p>According to Freud, the superego begins to emerge at around age five.</p>
            <p>The superego holds the internalized moral standards and ideals that we acquire from our parents and
                society (our sense of right and wrong).</p>
            <p>The superego provides guidelines for making judgments.</p>
            <p>The superego has two parts:</p>
            <p>The conscience includes information about things that are viewed as bad by parents and society. These
                behaviors are often forbidden and lead to bad consequences, punishments, or feelings of guilt and
                remorse.</p>
            <p>The ego ideal includes the rules and standards for behaviors that the ego aspires to.</p>
            <p>The superego is the primary culprit that we are concerned about within this analysis. In introductory
                courses, the id, ego, and superego are often presented in simplistic terms: with the id as the “devil on
                one shoulder” and the superego as “the angel on the other shoulder.” This is only true, however, if our
                intuition is always wrong and society is always right. Certainly, we can agree this is not the case.</p>
            <p>Our discontent in civilization arises not because of a heightening of our sense of guilt but rather
                through the heightening of the unconscious need for punishment that defends against the sense of guilt.
                It is beneficial to reflect on the Song of Roland and Dr. Shay’s assessment of REMFs, to understand how
                social structures can stand in the way of a soldier’s ability to feel guilt (or rather, even to admit
                they should feel guilt).</p>
            <p>What would happen if our “conscience” (our internal morality) and “ego ideal” (what people we respect say
                is moral) were in conflict?</p>
            <p>Since most of us do not possess the strength of character for conscious suppression and self-mastery
                without lying to ourselves, most people, including our soldiers, will be forced to fall back on
                repression, with the disguised return of the repressed that repression itself inevitably entails. Those
                are some ten-dollar words, but think of it like this:</p>
            <p>Example Soldier Story</p>
            <p>The disguised return of the repressed guilt is often manifested in the form of the sadistic superego
                redirecting the id’s aggression away from the object world (e.g., the REMFs who contradicted the moral
                code) and against the ego (ourselves). This results in various forms of self-punishment; Freud described
                the “moral masochism” in terms of “the criminal from a sense of guilt,” “those wrecked by success,” and
                other self-sabotaging and self-tormenting character-types.</p>
            <p>Do we see this illustrated in Shakespeare’s work when we apply Dr. Shay’s viewpoint? Without recognizing
                the feeling of guilt, a subject’s unconscious superego frequently judges him or her to be guilty.
                Frequently, instead of allowing oneself to feel guilty (whether such guilt is justified or not is
                another matter), the subject (the soldier, or in this case, Hamlet) often unconsciously seeks external
                punishment unrelated to the actual offense committed (e.g., alcoholism or even suicide).</p>
            <p>The feeling of guilt that might accompany the state of being guilty, or being capable of judging oneself
                to be guilty, is absent because this feeling of guilt is unbearable or unacceptable, and in many ways,
                we have not seen a character who struggles with such a modern dilemma. It was not morally “wrong” for
                Achilles to slay Hector; it was tragic. Nor was it “illegal” for Beowulf to face the dragon, but the
                lack of belief and support led to his demise. For Hamlet, the death of his father demands vengeance, but
                it is also immoral for him to kill as a modern Christian man.</p>
            <p>So, first, let us tackle the subject of Hamlet’s “failure to act.” Herein, we need to look at three key
                scenes: Hamlet slaying Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet slaying Polonius, and ultimately the
                “ineffectual” scene where Hamlet fails to kill his uncle Claudius while Claudius is praying. I know it
                may seem strange to go in reverse chronological order, but it helps to understand Hamlet’s mindset.
                First, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s death is the clearest example of Hamlet’s overarching sense of
                vengeance and capability for cruelty. When he finds the letter demanding his own death upon arrival in
                England, he does not hesitate to have his former friends take his place in death. Likewise, when Hamlet
                confronts his mother in her chambers, and he believes that it is his uncle behind the tapestry, Hamlet
                does not hesitate for a moment; he stabs Polonius without even checking to see who is truly hiding
                there. These two scenes do not paint a picture of a man who is afraid of violence, cruelty, or action.
            </p>
            <p>So, why does he fail to kill Claudius when he has the chance? Hamlet himself tells us:</p>
            <p>He took my father grossly, full of bread,</p>
            <p>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;</p>
            <p>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven.</p>
            <p>But in our circumstance and course of thought</p>
            <p>’Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged</p>
            <p>To take him in the purging of his soul,</p>
            <p>When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?</p>
            <p>No. (92)</p>
            <p>Hamlet is concerned with justice, especially with respect to his guilt-driven culture. The punishment
                must be fair, or at least feel fair. This does not reflect an inability to act; it reflects a complex
                rumination on the justness of Claudius’ death.</p>
            <p>So, what does all of this have to do with guilt, soldiers or others who have PTSD and the repressed
                desire for punishment? I know this has gotten complex, but we will use Hamlet to bring it all together.
                It is stated that:</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, evading guilt-feeling in this way precludes the rational evaluation of such guilt that
                would enable us to decide whether to accept and make reparation for our actions or to reject it as
                irrational and unfounded. One may not be guilty at all, but the repression of guilt stops that judgment
                from ever taking place.</p>
            <p>This modern moral dilemma is played out in the most famous soliloquy:</p>
            <p>To be or not to be—that is the question:</p>
            <p>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
            <p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
            <p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles</p>
            <p>And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep—</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there’s the rub,</p>
            <p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</p>
            <p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
            <p>Must give us pause. There’s the respect</p>
            <p>That makes calamity of so long life.</p>
            <p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
            <p>Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</p>
            <p>The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,</p>
            <p>The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
            <p>That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,</p>
            <p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>
            <p>With a bare bodkin?…</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</p>
            <p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
            <p>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</p>
            <p>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</p>
            <p>With this regard their currents turn awry</p>
            <p>And lose the name of action. —</p>
            <p>The central question here is one we are all familiar with. While it feels right and fair to do something,
                it is wrong or against the law; therefore, we do not act. Does our inaction make us all ineffectual or
                incapable of acting? No. However, it does highlight the need for repression and how such a conflict
                results in someone, like a soldier who has PTSD, punishing themselves even when they are not guilty.
                Like Hamlet, to kill a good, god-fearing man who is free of sin (this is how Hamlet would have seen
                Claudius after prayer), even in service of one’s country, would feel wrong, as would killing a town full
                of civilians, as noted in previous chapters.</p>
            <p>Unlike Hamlet, the soldiers exampled above did act. As noted in the “Betrayal of What’s Right,” the
                schism between doing something they knew was morally wrong and being rewarded for that action led to the
                downward spiral that PTSD represents. Such repressed guilt cannot be recognized, so it is unleashed in
                other ways. For Hamlet, it is the sabotaging of his relationship with Ophelia. For soldiers, it is often
                manifested in alcoholism, nightmares, and suicide.</p>
            <p>I cannot transition into the next module on women without speaking up for the women in Shakespeare’s most
                famous tragedy. First, Ophelia, the tragic heroine, is often seen as having no agency. While it is true
                that she has very little and that she is treated rather poorly, there is more to her scenes than may
                meet the eye. Specifically, in Act Four, Scene Five, when Ophelia states:</p>
            <p>There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.</p>
            <p>Pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies,</p>
            <p>that’s for thoughts.</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>There’s fennel for you, and columbines.</p>
            <p>There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me; we</p>
            <p>may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. You must wear</p>
            <p>your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would</p>
            <p>give you some violets, but they withered all when</p>
            <p>my father died. They say he made a good end.</p>
            <p>Sings. For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.</p>
            <p>This, perhaps, sounds like madness to us, but consider poor Ophelia and how much she can or cannot say in
                her position without punishment, especially by a King or Queen who is willing to kill their own son. For
                a little context, in English history, especially around the Elizabethan era, flowers had a great deal of
                symbolism:</p>
            <p>Rosemary and Pansies: Ophelia gives these flowers to Laertes; she even cites them as being for
                remembrance and thoughts.</p>
            <p>Fennel and Columbine: To King Claudius, Ophelia delivers a bold message: Fennel is the symbol for
                flattery, and columbine is considered the flower for “deceived lovers,” a symbol of male adultery and
                faithlessness.</p>
            <p>Rue: Rue is the symbol for bitterness, thought to be the cause of most abortions in that day, and often
                connected with adultery. Ophelia gives this flower to Queen Gertrude, as well as keeping some for
                herself.</p>
            <p>Daisy: Ophelia picks up and sets down the daisy without giving it to anyone. This is interesting because
                the daisy is the symbol of innocence and gentleness. Evidently, Ophelia thought there was no place for
                innocence in the Danish court anymore.</p>
            <p>Violets: Finally, Ophelia says that she would have brought violets but that they all withered when her
                father died. This is a fascinating note for Ophelia to close on because violets are the symbol of
                faithfulness and fidelity.</p>
            <p>In her own way, Ophelia was calling out everyone in the room for what they were. Curiously, however,
                Claudius does not seem to get the worst of it. Gertrude is being accused of adultery, bitterness, and
                abortion. It is as if Ophelia is telling Gertrude that she knows Gertrude tried to kill her own son.
                Furthermore, consider Ophelia’s lines just before the latter passage:</p>
            <p>You must sing “A-down a-down”—and you</p>
            <p>“Call him a-down-a.”—O, how the wheel becomes</p>
            <p>it! It is the false steward that stole his master’s</p>
            <p>daughter.</p>
            <p>Down, down, it is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter. It begs the question, who is the
                falsest person in the play? It is the traditional viewpoint that Claudius is the mastermind and
                antagonist of this play, but I challenge that this may be due to the focus on Hamlet as someone who
                suffers from the Oedipus complex. That is, Hamlet’s reluctance to kill Claudius is thought to be rooted
                in the Oedipus complex, a Freudian concept of a child’s rivalry or opposition towards his father due to
                his unconscious psychosexual affection towards his mother. If, however, Hamlet’s failure to act is
                instead due to the conflict within his superego, then this is not true. Furthermore, if we examine
                Claudius’ prayer scene a little more closely, it is strange that he feels such remorse if it were his
                plan to kill his brother. Shakespeare does not shy away from a strong woman antagonist, see Lady
                Macbeth, and it is worth considering that right after Ophelia makes this pronouncement, she “dies” by
                “possible suicide” when climbing on a branch, and the Queen watches as she slowly sinks and her dress
                slowly splays out in the stream. Gertrude does not mention attempting to save Ophelia even once.</p>
            <p>Perhaps she wanted a man she could control.</p>
