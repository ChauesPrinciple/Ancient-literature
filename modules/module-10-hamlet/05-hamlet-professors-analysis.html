            </header>

            <article class="prose">
                <figure class="image-placeholder"
                    style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0; padding: 2rem; background: #f5f5f5; border-radius: 8px;">
                    <em>[Image: The First Folio of Hamlet]</em>
                </figure>

                <p>Hamlet may not seem like an obvious choice for this chapter on warriors. He is notorious for his
                    inaction, right? By some, maybe, but let us dig a bit deeper into the action of the play, and
                    whether Hamlet is truly as fickle as he has been accused.</p>

                <div class="callout-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #d4edda 0%, #c3e6cb 100%); border-left: 4px solid #28a745; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Thesis:</strong> It is the position of this analysis that Hamlet is
                        acting rationally; he is also the first model of the <strong>modern existential dilemma</strong>
                        that we, and our soldiers, face.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Honor Culture vs. Guilt Culture</h3>
                <p>In most of our texts, we are dealing with <strong>honor-based societies</strong>. This is true for
                    Gilgamesh, the Iliad, Beowulf, and the Bhagavad Gita, but distinctly not the Song of Roland or
                    Hamlet, which fall under the <strong>Guilt Culture</strong> area. In Beowulf and the Song of Roland,
                    we see the bookending of the transitional period between the honor-based warrior culture and the
                    modern guilt-based Christian society of our modern world. Hamlet, on the other hand, shows us the
                    inherent internal conflict of the modern person:</p>

                <div class="highlight-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3cd 0%, #ffeeba 100%); border: 2px solid #856404; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>Is the warrior ethos of <strong>revenge</strong> or the
                            Christian ethos of <strong>forgiveness</strong> of higher-order concern?</em></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Freudian Framework: Id, Ego, and Superego</h3>
                <p>Naturally, to explore this internal conflict, we will need to define some terms of the mind, via
                    psychoanalysis:</p>

                <div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <h4 style="color: #721c24; margin-top: 0;">Id — Instinctual Drives Present at Birth</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does not distinguish between reality and fantasy</li>
                        <li>Operates according to the <strong>pleasure principle</strong>—drive toward immediate
                            gratification</li>
                        <li>Sources of energy:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Eros</strong>—life instinct perpetuates life</li>
                                <li><strong>Libido</strong>—sexual energy or motivation</li>
                                <li><strong>Thanatos</strong>—death instinct, aggression, self-destructive actions</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="color: #155724;">Ego — Develops Out of the Id in Infancy</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understands reality and logic</li>
                        <li>A mediator between the id and superego</li>
                        <li>Rational, organized, logical, and mediator to demands of reality</li>
                        <li><strong>Reality principle</strong>—the ability to postpone gratification in accordance with
                            demands of reality</li>
                        <li>Can repress desires that cannot be met in an acceptable manner</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="color: #004085;">Superego — Internalization of Societal & Parental Moral Standards</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One's conscience; focuses on what the person "should" do</li>
                        <li>Develops around ages 5-6</li>
                        <li>Partially unconscious</li>
                        <li>Can be harshly punitive using feelings of guilt</li>
                        <li>The superego has two parts:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The Conscience</strong>: Information about things viewed as bad by parents
                                    and society</li>
                                <li><strong>The Ego Ideal</strong>: Rules and standards for behaviors that the ego
                                    aspires to</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box"
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f8d7da 0%, #f5c6cb 100%); border-left: 4px solid #721c24; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The superego is the primary culprit in this
                        analysis. In introductory courses, the id, ego, and superego are often presented simplistically:
                        with the id as the "devil on one shoulder" and the superego as "the angel on the other." This is
                        only true, however, if our intuition is always wrong and society is always right. <em>Certainly,
                            we can agree this is not the case.</em></p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Conflict Within</h3>
                <p>Our discontent in civilization arises not because of a heightening of our sense of guilt but rather
                    through the heightening of the <strong>unconscious need for punishment</strong> that defends against
                    the sense of guilt. It is beneficial to reflect on the Song of Roland and Dr. Shay's assessment of
                    REMFs, to understand how social structures can stand in the way of a soldier's ability to feel
                    guilt.</p>

                <p><em>What would happen if our "conscience" (our internal morality) and "ego ideal" (what people we
                        respect say is moral) were in conflict?</em></p>

                <p>Since most of us do not possess the strength of character for conscious suppression and self-mastery
                    without lying to ourselves, most people, including our soldiers, will be forced to fall back on
                    repression, with the <strong>disguised return of the repressed</strong> that repression itself
                    inevitably entails.</p>

                <p>The disguised return of the repressed guilt is often manifested in the form of the sadistic superego
                    redirecting the id's aggression away from the object world (e.g., the REMFs who contradicted the
                    moral code) and <strong>against the ego (ourselves)</strong>. This results in various forms of
                    self-punishment; Freud described the "moral masochism" in terms of "the criminal from a sense of
                    guilt," "those wrecked by success," and other self-sabotaging and self-tormenting character-types.
                </p>

                <h3>Hamlet's "Failure to Act"</h3>
                <p>Do we see this illustrated in Shakespeare's work when we apply Dr. Shay's viewpoint? The feeling of
                    guilt that might accompany the state of being guilty is absent because this feeling is unbearable or
                    unacceptable. In many ways, we have not seen a character who struggles with such a modern dilemma:
                </p>

                <ul
                    style="background: #e2e3e5; padding: 1.5rem 1.5rem 1.5rem 2.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <li>It was not morally "wrong" for <strong>Achilles</strong> to slay Hector; it was tragic.</li>
                    <li>Nor was it "illegal" for <strong>Beowulf</strong> to face the dragon, but the lack of belief and
                        support led to his demise.</li>
                    <li>For <strong>Hamlet</strong>, the death of his father demands vengeance, but it is also immoral
                        for him to kill as a modern Christian man.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let us tackle the subject of Hamlet's "failure to act." We need to look at <strong>three key
                        scenes</strong>:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hamlet slaying Rosencrantz and Guildenstern:</strong> When he finds the letter demanding
                        his own death upon arrival in England, he does not hesitate to have his former friends take his
                        place in death.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hamlet slaying Polonius:</strong> When Hamlet confronts his mother in her chambers and
                        believes it is his uncle behind the tapestry, Hamlet does not hesitate for a moment—he stabs
                        Polonius without even checking who is truly hiding there.</li>
                    <li><strong>The "ineffectual" scene:</strong> Where Hamlet fails to kill Claudius while Claudius is
                        praying.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>These first two scenes do not paint a picture of a man who is afraid of violence, cruelty, or action.
                    So, <em>why does he fail to kill Claudius when he has the chance?</em> Hamlet himself tells us:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; white-space: pre-line;">He took my father grossly, full of bread,
                        With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
                        And how his audit stands who knows save heaven.
                        But in our circumstance and course of thought
                        'Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged
                        To take him in the purging of his soul,
                        When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
                        <strong>No.</strong> (III.iii)
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Hamlet is concerned with <strong>justice</strong>, especially with respect to his guilt-driven
                    culture. The punishment must be fair, or at least feel fair. This does not reflect an inability to
                    act; it reflects a complex rumination on the justness of Claudius' death.</p>

                <h3>The "To Be or Not To Be" Soliloquy</h3>
                <p>This modern moral dilemma is played out in the most famous soliloquy:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e2e3e5 0%, #d6d8db 100%); border-left: 4px solid #333; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; white-space: pre-line;">To be or not to be—that is the question:
                        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
                        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
                        And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep—
                        …
                        To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub,
                        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
                        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
                        Must give us pause...
                        …
                        <strong>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</strong>
                        And thus the native hue of resolution
                        Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
                        And enterprises of great pitch and moment
                        With this regard their currents turn awry
                        And lose the name of action.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The central question here is one we are all familiar with. While it feels right and fair to do
                    something, it is wrong or against the law; therefore, we do not act. Does our inaction make us all
                    ineffectual? <strong>No.</strong> However, it does highlight the need for repression and how such a
                    conflict results in someone, like a soldier who has PTSD, punishing themselves even when they are
                    not guilty.</p>

                <p>Unlike Hamlet, the soldiers in previous examples did act. As noted in the "Betrayal of What's Right,"
                    the schism between doing something they knew was morally wrong and being rewarded for that action
                    led to the downward spiral that PTSD represents. Such repressed guilt cannot be recognized, so it is
                    unleashed in other ways. For Hamlet, it is the sabotaging of his relationship with Ophelia. For
                    soldiers, it is often manifested in alcoholism, nightmares, and suicide.</p>

                <h3>Speaking Up for the Women: Ophelia</h3>
                <p>I cannot transition into the next module on women without speaking up for the women in Shakespeare's
                    most famous tragedy. First, Ophelia, the tragic heroine, is often seen as having no agency. While it
                    is true that she has very little and that she is treated rather poorly, there is more to her scenes
                    than may meet the eye.</p>

                <p>Specifically, in Act Four, Scene Five, when Ophelia states:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; white-space: pre-line;">There's rosemary, that's for remembrance.
                        Pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies,
                        that's for thoughts.
                        …
                        There's fennel for you, and columbines.
                        There's rue for you, and here's some for me; we
                        may call it herb of grace o' Sundays. You must wear
                        your rue with a difference. There's a daisy. I would
                        give you some violets, but they withered all when
                        my father died. They say he made a good end.</p>

                <p>This, perhaps, sounds like madness to us, but consider poor Ophelia and how much she can or cannot
                    say in her position without punishment. In English history, especially around the Elizabethan era,
                    <strong>flowers had a great deal of symbolism</strong>:

                            <em>flattery</em>, and columbine is the flower for "deceived lovers," a symbol of <em>male
                                adultery and faithlessness</em>.

                            there was no place for innocence in the Danish court anymore.</dd>

                <p>In her own way, <strong>Ophelia was calling out everyone in the room for what they were.</strong>
                    Curiously, however, Claudius does not seem to get the worst of it. Gertrude is being accused of
                    adultery, bitterness, and abortion. It is as if Ophelia is telling Gertrude that she knows Gertrude
                    tried to kill her own son.</p>

                <h3>A Reinterpretation: The True Antagonist?</h3>
                <p>Furthermore, consider Ophelia's lines just before the latter passage:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #856404; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">You must sing "A-down a-down"—and you "Call him a-down-a."—O, how the wheel
                        becomes it! <strong>It is the false steward that stole his master's daughter.</strong></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p><em>"It is the false steward that stole his master's daughter."</em> It begs the question, who is the
                    falsest person in the play?</p>

                <p>It is the traditional viewpoint that Claudius is the mastermind and antagonist of this play, but I
                    challenge that this may be due to the focus on Hamlet as someone who suffers from the
                    <strong>Oedipus complex</strong>—a Freudian concept of a child's rivalry towards his father due to
                    unconscious psychosexual affection towards his mother. If, however, Hamlet's failure to act is
                    instead due to the conflict within his superego, then this interpretation is not necessarily true.
                </p>

                <p>Furthermore, if we examine Claudius' prayer scene a little more closely, it is strange that he feels
                    such remorse if it were his plan to kill his brother. Shakespeare does not shy away from a strong
                    woman antagonist (see Lady Macbeth), and it is worth considering that right after Ophelia makes this
                    pronouncement, she "dies" by "possible suicide" when climbing on a branch, and <strong>the Queen
                        watches as she slowly sinks</strong> and her dress slowly splays out in the stream. Gertrude
                    does not mention attempting to save Ophelia even once.</p>
