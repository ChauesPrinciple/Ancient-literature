<h2>Hamlet Analysis</h2>
<div class="image-placeholder" style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;"><em>[Image Intended: The First Folio of Hamlet]</em></div>
<p>Hamlet may not seem like an obvious choice for this chapter on warriors. He is notorious for his inaction, right? By some, maybe, but let us dig a bit deeper into the action of the play, and whether Hamlet is truly as fickle as he has been accused. It is the position of this analysis that he is acting rationally; he is also the first model of the modern existential dilemma that we, and our soldiers, face.</p>
<p>In most of our texts, we are dealing with honor-based societies. This is true for Gilgamesh, the Iliad, Beowulf, and the Bhagavad Gita, but distinctly not the Song of Roland or Hamlet, which fall under the Guilt Culture Area. In Beowulf and the Song of Roland, we see the bookending of the transitional period between the honor-based warrior culture and the modern guilt-based Christian society of our modern world. The latter being the beginning, and the former being the conclusion of this process, both of which mark the conversion of the Germanic societal norms. Hamlet, on the other hand, shows us the inherent internal conflict of the modern person: is the warrior ethos of revenge or the Christian ethos of forgiveness of higher-order concern?</p>
<p>Naturally, to explore this internal conflict, we will need to define some terms of the mind, ala psychoanalysis:</p>
<p>Id—instinctual drives present at birth</p>
<p>Does not distinguish between reality and fantasy.</p>
<p>Operates according to the pleasure principle—drive toward immediate gratification, the most fundamental human motive.</p>
<p>Sources of energy:</p>
<p>Eros—life instinct perpetuates life.</p>
<p>Libido—sexual energy or motivation</p>
<p>Thanatos—death instinct, aggression, self-destructive actions</p>
<p>Ego—develops out of the id in infancy</p>
<p>Understands reality and logic.</p>
<p>A mediator between the id and superego</p>
<p>The part of the personality that mediates the demands of the id without going against the restraints of the superego.</p>
<p>Rational, organized, logical, and mediator to demands of reality.</p>
<p>Reality principle—the ability to postpone gratification in accordance with demands of reality.</p>
<p>Can repress desires that cannot be met in an acceptable manner.</p>
<p>Superego:</p>
<p>Internalization of societal & parental moral standards</p>
<p>One’s conscience; focuses on what the person “should” do.</p>
<p>Develops around ages 5-6.</p>
<p>Partially unconscious</p>
<p>It can be harshly punitive using feelings of guilt.</p>
<p>The last component of personality to develop</p>
<p>According to Freud, the superego begins to emerge at around age five.</p>
<p>The superego holds the internalized moral standards and ideals that we acquire from our parents and society (our sense of right and wrong).</p>
<p>The superego provides guidelines for making judgments.</p>
<p>The superego has two parts:</p>
<p>The conscience includes information about things that are viewed as bad by parents and society. These behaviors are often forbidden and lead to bad consequences, punishments, or feelings of guilt and remorse.</p>
<p>The ego ideal includes the rules and standards for behaviors that the ego aspires to.</p>
<p>The superego is the primary culprit that we are concerned about within this analysis. In introductory courses, the id, ego, and superego are often presented in simplistic terms: with the id as the “devil on one shoulder” and the superego as “the angel on the other shoulder.” This is only true, however, if our intuition is always wrong and society is always right. Certainly, we can agree this is not the case.</p>
<p>Our discontent in civilization arises not because of a heightening of our sense of guilt but rather through the heightening of the unconscious need for punishment that defends against the sense of guilt. It is beneficial to reflect on the Song of Roland and Dr. Shay’s assessment of REMFs, to understand how social structures can stand in the way of a soldier’s ability to feel guilt (or rather, even to admit they should feel guilt).</p>
<p>What would happen if our “conscience” (our internal morality) and “ego ideal” (what people we respect say is moral) were in conflict?</p>
<p>Since most of us do not possess the strength of character for conscious suppression and self-mastery without lying to ourselves, most people, including our soldiers, will be forced to fall back on repression, with the disguised return of the repressed that repression itself inevitably entails. Those are some ten-dollar words, but think of it like this:</p>
<p>Example Soldier Story</p>
<p>The disguised return of the repressed guilt is often manifested in the form of the sadistic superego redirecting the id’s aggression away from the object world (e.g., the REMFs who contradicted the moral code) and against the ego (ourselves). This results in various forms of self-punishment; Freud described the “moral masochism” in terms of “the criminal from a sense of guilt,” “those wrecked by success,” and other self-sabotaging and self-tormenting character-types.</p>
<p>Do we see this illustrated in Shakespeare’s work when we apply Dr. Shay’s viewpoint? Without recognizing the feeling of guilt, a subject’s unconscious superego frequently judges him or her to be guilty. Frequently, instead of allowing oneself to feel guilty (whether such guilt is justified or not is another matter), the subject (the soldier, or in this case, Hamlet) often unconsciously seeks external punishment unrelated to the actual offense committed (e.g., alcoholism or even suicide).</p>
<p>The feeling of guilt that might accompany the state of being guilty, or being capable of judging oneself to be guilty, is absent because this feeling of guilt is unbearable or unacceptable, and in many ways, we have not seen a character who struggles with such a modern dilemma. It was not morally “wrong” for Achilles to slay Hector; it was tragic. Nor was it “illegal” for Beowulf to face the dragon, but the lack of belief and support led to his demise. For Hamlet, the death of his father demands vengeance, but it is also immoral for him to kill as a modern Christian man.</p>
<p>So, first, let us tackle the subject of Hamlet’s “failure to act.” Herein, we need to look at three key scenes: Hamlet slaying Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet slaying Polonius, and ultimately the “ineffectual” scene where Hamlet fails to kill his uncle Claudius while Claudius is praying. I know it may seem strange to go in reverse chronological order, but it helps to understand Hamlet’s mindset. First, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s death is the clearest example of Hamlet’s overarching sense of vengeance and capability for cruelty. When he finds the letter demanding his own death upon arrival in England, he does not hesitate to have his former friends take his place in death. Likewise, when Hamlet confronts his mother in her chambers, and he believes that it is his uncle behind the tapestry, Hamlet does not hesitate for a moment; he stabs Polonius without even checking to see who is truly hiding there. These two scenes do not paint a picture of a man who is afraid of violence, cruelty, or action.</p>
<p>So, why does he fail to kill Claudius when he has the chance? Hamlet himself tells us:</p>
<p>He took my father grossly, full of bread,</p>
<p>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;</p>
<p>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven.</p>
<p>But in our circumstance and course of thought</p>
<p>’Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged</p>
<p>To take him in the purging of his soul,</p>
<p>When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?</p>
<p>No. (92)</p>
<p>Hamlet is concerned with justice, especially with respect to his guilt-driven culture. The punishment must be fair, or at least feel fair. This does not reflect an inability to act; it reflects a complex rumination on the justness of Claudius’ death.</p>
<p>So, what does all of this have to do with guilt, soldiers or others who have PTSD and the repressed desire for punishment? I know this has gotten complex, but we will use Hamlet to bring it all together. It is stated that:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, evading guilt-feeling in this way precludes the rational evaluation of such guilt that would enable us to decide whether to accept and make reparation for our actions or to reject it as irrational and unfounded. One may not be guilty at all, but the repression of guilt stops that judgment from ever taking place.</p>
<p>This modern moral dilemma is played out in the most famous soliloquy:</p>
<p>To be or not to be—that is the question:</p>
<p>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles</p>
<p>And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep—</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there’s the rub,</p>
<p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
<p>Must give us pause. There’s the respect</p>
<p>That makes calamity of so long life.</p>
<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
<p>Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</p>
<p>The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,</p>
<p>The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
<p>That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,</p>
<p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>
<p>With a bare bodkin?…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</p>
<p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
<p>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</p>
<p>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</p>
<p>With this regard their currents turn awry</p>
<p>And lose the name of action. —</p>
<p>The central question here is one we are all familiar with. While it feels right and fair to do something, it is wrong or against the law; therefore, we do not act. Does our inaction make us all ineffectual or incapable of acting? No. However, it does highlight the need for repression and how such a conflict results in someone, like a soldier who has PTSD, punishing themselves even when they are not guilty. Like Hamlet, to kill a good, god-fearing man who is free of sin (this is how Hamlet would have seen Claudius after prayer), even in service of one’s country, would feel wrong, as would killing a town full of civilians, as noted in previous chapters.</p>
<p>Unlike Hamlet, the soldiers exampled above did act. As noted in the “Betrayal of What’s Right,” the schism between doing something they knew was morally wrong and being rewarded for that action led to the downward spiral that PTSD represents. Such repressed guilt cannot be recognized, so it is unleashed in other ways. For Hamlet, it is the sabotaging of his relationship with Ophelia. For soldiers, it is often manifested in alcoholism, nightmares, and suicide.</p>
<p>I cannot transition into the next module on women without speaking up for the women in Shakespeare’s most famous tragedy. First, Ophelia, the tragic heroine, is often seen as having no agency. While it is true that she has very little and that she is treated rather poorly, there is more to her scenes than may meet the eye. Specifically, in Act Four, Scene Five, when Ophelia states:</p>
<p>There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.</p>
<p>Pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies,</p>
<p>that’s for thoughts.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There’s fennel for you, and columbines.</p>
<p>There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me; we</p>
<p>may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. You must wear</p>
<p>your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would</p>
<p>give you some violets, but they withered all when</p>
<p>my father died. They say he made a good end.</p>
<p>Sings. For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.</p>
<p>This, perhaps, sounds like madness to us, but consider poor Ophelia and how much she can or cannot say in her position without punishment, especially by a King or Queen who is willing to kill their own son. For a little context, in English history, especially around the Elizabethan era, flowers had a great deal of symbolism:</p>
<p>Rosemary and Pansies: Ophelia gives these flowers to Laertes; she even cites them as being for remembrance and thoughts.</p>
<p>Fennel and Columbine: To King Claudius, Ophelia delivers a bold message: Fennel is the symbol for flattery, and columbine is considered the flower for “deceived lovers,” a symbol of male adultery and faithlessness.</p>
<p>Rue: Rue is the symbol for bitterness, thought to be the cause of most abortions in that day, and often connected with adultery. Ophelia gives this flower to Queen Gertrude, as well as keeping some for herself.</p>
<p>Daisy: Ophelia picks up and sets down the daisy without giving it to anyone. This is interesting because the daisy is the symbol of innocence and gentleness. Evidently, Ophelia thought there was no place for innocence in the Danish court anymore.</p>
<p>Violets: Finally, Ophelia says that she would have brought violets but that they all withered when her father died. This is a fascinating note for Ophelia to close on because violets are the symbol of faithfulness and fidelity.</p>
<p>In her own way, Ophelia was calling out everyone in the room for what they were. Curiously, however, Claudius does not seem to get the worst of it. Gertrude is being accused of adultery, bitterness, and abortion. It is as if Ophelia is telling Gertrude that she knows Gertrude tried to kill her own son. Furthermore, consider Ophelia’s lines just before the latter passage:</p>
<p>You must sing “A-down a-down”—and you</p>
<p>“Call him a-down-a.”—O, how the wheel becomes</p>
<p>it! It is the false steward that stole his master’s</p>
<p>daughter.</p>
<p>Down, down, it is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter. It begs the question, who is the falsest person in the play? It is the traditional viewpoint that Claudius is the mastermind and antagonist of this play, but I challenge that this may be due to the focus on Hamlet as someone who suffers from the Oedipus complex. That is, Hamlet’s reluctance to kill Claudius is thought to be rooted in the Oedipus complex, a Freudian concept of a child’s rivalry or opposition towards his father due to his unconscious psychosexual affection towards his mother. If, however, Hamlet’s failure to act is instead due to the conflict within his superego, then this is not true. Furthermore, if we examine Claudius’ prayer scene a little more closely, it is strange that he feels such remorse if it were his plan to kill his brother. Shakespeare does not shy away from a strong woman antagonist, see Lady Macbeth, and it is worth considering that right after Ophelia makes this pronouncement, she “dies” by “possible suicide” when climbing on a branch, and the Queen watches as she slowly sinks and her dress slowly splays out in the stream. Gertrude does not mention attempting to save Ophelia even once.</p>
<p>Perhaps she wanted a man she could control.</p>
<p>Medea</p>
<div class="image-placeholder" style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;"><em>[Image Intended: Manuscript of Medea]</em></div>
<p>When discussing Medea, it is essential to remember that the titular revenge seeker of the play, Medea, is royalty from Colchis, the land of the magical Golden Fleece. First, this establishes the depth of betrayal by Jason, but it also situates Medea as Jason's equal. Not only is her father the King, but her Grandfather is Helios, the Sun God. She met and fell in love with Jason when he arrived in Caucus on his quest for the Golden Fleece. It is also important to remember that Medea possesses magical powers and uses them to help Jason in this quest. Medea's otherworldly power establishes her, like other "problematic and masculine women," like Grendel's mother, as "monstrous."</p>
<p>Thus, after betraying her family and assisting in her own brother's death, the newlywed couple arrived in Corinth, where they began raising their children. However, Jason then left Medea to marry the Princess of Corinth, and now it has become clear there is only one person Jason cares about: himself. Through betrayal and Jason and other dominant men's ability to strip Medea of all agency, Euripides highlights the inequalities of gender in their society.</p>
<p>The play opens with Medea raging at Jason's betrayal, much like Achilles in the Iliad. She plots to execute vengeance on her former husband, killing his new wife, King Creon, the King of Corinth, and even rejects her parental feelings when she kills her children at the end of the play to make sure all members of Jason's house dies entirely. Her plan is sinister and violent. Nevertheless, as we shall see, she is often a sympathetic figure, having been betrayed by a callous husband who broke his marriage's sacred oath.</p>
<p>While the betrayal, rage, and vengeance that Medea enacts may remind us of Achilles and the cycle of PTSD described by Dr. Shay. It is Julia Kristeva’s concept of the abjection of women that cuts closest to the bone that Euripides is gnawing on here. According to Kristeva, the feminist struggle must be seen historically and politically as a three-tiered one, which can be schematically summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Women demand equal access to the symbolic order.</p>
<p>Women reject the male symbolic order in the name of difference.</p>
<p>Women reject the dichotomy between masculine and feminine metaphysically.</p>
<p>More specifically: Kristeva observes that men and women are not innately different but are viewed differently due to their social positions, and thus claiming that there is no opposition between feminine and masculine in pre-Oedipality. We see this in action in Medea: Jason is supported by Medea's magic, and only completes the series of complex tasks set by her father, the King of Colchis, because of her military prowess, not his. Medea has loved and helped him throughout his exploits, yet it is precisely because of her strength that Jason and the King of Colchis fear her! He claims to want to help his family by leaving Medea, but she does not see that as a valid excuse. Jason is unbelievably cruel to Medea throughout the play, and the chorus clarifies that while they do not want Medea to murder their children, Jason deserves severe punishment.</p>
<p>Euripides' Medea is a dangerous person, much like Medusa, Grendel's mother in Beowulf, Pandora in Works and Days, many of the women in One Thousand and One Nights, including the Kings’ wives, The Wife of Bath in the Canterbury Tales, to name a few. To be clear, Medea is not monstrous because of what she did to her children—especially since it is not original to the myth it is not Medea who slays the children—but because she defended women's rights and deplored their treatment by men, and that she acted in a “masculine” way. This was anathema in fifth-century Athens. In the play, she is supported by the Corinthian women's conspiratorial silence, although their King is at risk. Euripides' female characters were not the ideal females of the Periclean funeral oration: they were radicals with perilous ideas.</p>
<p>In Aristophanes' comedy The Frogs, produced in 405, the god Dionysus journeys to the underworld to bring back Euripides, who died the previous year. Once there, Dionysus learns that Aeschylus challenges his desire to recover Euripides because he would serve the gods' purpose for Athens better and give the people better advice. In the end, Dionysus chooses Aeschylus. Why does Dionysus want to bring back a poet to teach the people wisdom? Comic poets were more blatant in their political commentary and advice, but they had greater freedom with their storylines. Tragic poets had political opinions, which they expressed by the timing of their productions (e.g., Euripides wrote The Trojan Women right after the Athenian destruction of Melos in 416), by manipulating the details of the myths, and by the resultant symbolism.</p>
<p>Euripides was current, topical, and deconstructive. In Medea, he forces the Athenian society to confront the image of a woman acting like what a man would in a similar scenario. She was meant to be queen, and she notes multiple times that she will not be looked down upon, laughed at, or ridiculed. In essence, she must protect her honor: this position of power, which she supports with an authentic military prowess that surpasses Jason’s, situates Medea alongside heroes like Achilles, Odysseus, and Ajax. Every single one of these men killed hundreds, if not thousands, of children in their bid for revenge. Nevertheless, they are heroes. Medea is a monster not because she killed innocents, nor because among them were her children; she is perceived as a monster because she is a woman, and people expect women to act differently than they do men.</p>
<p>Boys will be boys, right? Euripides is on the side of Kristeva; he clearly outlines the abjection of women through Medea and the double standard of the Patriarchal system, which led to Medea’s betrayal in the first place.</p>
<p>One Thousand and One Nights</p>
<div class="image-placeholder" style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;"><em>[Image Intended: An Arabic Manuscript of 1001 Nights]</em></div>
<p>One of the themes running throughout the entire One Thousand and One Nights is the oppressor and the oppressed. This is Scheherazade’s chosen strategy and specific act of agency by employing a feminine virtue. Many stories explore this theme explicitly, and it is all meant to tacitly persuade Shahryar to reason. We see this tension of the oppressor and the oppressed throughout various tales: “the powerful Djinn locked in bottles, kings and their servants, parents, and children” (). There are many examples of women battling for survival in unjust patriarchy, and the tales that mirror Scheherazade’s situation are the most poignant.</p>
<p>We also get to see many examples of women triumphing. Previously made powerless women find ways to regain some sovereignty while those who rule through hypocrisy and force are humbled. This contradiction, of course, relates directly to King Shahryar; it is precisely Shahryar’s irrationality towards his wife, for love, we will say, that he reacts so strongly. His love turns quickly to hate; it is a purely emotional response from an otherwise good King. The fact that his wife rules his emotions so profoundly points to the power she has over Shahryar. However, the love between Shahryar and his first, unfaithful wife is itself a lesson in misogyny. There is blatant hypocrisy in a man with multiple concubines becoming jealous of a spouse who is also unfaithful. The notion that Shahryar does not simply punish his wife but an entire kingdom’s worth of daughters further highlights how widespread misogyny was at the time. Shahryar and his brother, who are both representatives of an entire kingdom, punish all women for the actions of two women, and the system unjustly bases this conviction on a standard to which neither King would hold themselves.</p>
<p>Scheherazade weaves these stories for Shahryar with the intent to humanize women and educate them. The stories also follow the logical progression of deradicalizing Shahryar. The stories begin with brutal and dark content, mirroring Shahryar’s perspective, highlighting that adultery usually happens for a reason and that jealousy and violence always lead to misery. There is a story of a wicked woman and another of a man acting idiotically to balance the system. In time, she introduces a historical figure, Haroun al-Rashid, to act as a foil for the King. Haroun al-Rashid is known to have loved art, poetry, and music, but most notably: he believed all people should be treated equally.</p>
<p>In light of Scheherazade’s core purpose for recounting her tales, the treatment of One Thousand and One Nights by the European Imperialist colonizers is deeply ironic. Even after all the apparent plagiarism by Galland in his “translation” noted earlier, a few manuscripts discovered in the 1800s, which contained, for example, the orphan tales of Aladdin and Alibaba, helped solve the mystery of where these extra tales originated. We now know these were just elaborate fakes, amounting to retranslations into Arabic of Galland’s French version. It is as if Galland’s orientalist endeavor could not be escaped.</p>
<p>Entered the two best-known English translations of The Nights: Edward Lane’s, published from 1838 to 1841, and Richard Francis Burton’s, published from 1885 to 1887. In the interest of time, we will skip over Lane’s contribution. He is an interesting fellow but not as relevant here. Lane and Burton were the exact opposites; Lane was concise, while Burton was verbose if we are kind. Whereas Lane labored hard to make his work family-friendly and palatable to the broadest possible audience, Burton accentuated the erotic elements of The Nights. At the time, Burton’s work was available only to a small society of discrete, many of whom one would imagine creepy, gentlemanly subscribers. Burton is one of the most colorful and appalling characters in the history of the Middle East studies. He was a soldier with a gift for languages who thought of himself as a scholar and archaeologist. Some considered him one of the Victorian Age’s great explorers. He traveled throughout the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. He is best known for two achievements: being one of the co-discoverers of the source of the Nile and disguising himself as a Muslim to go on a pilgrimage to Meccah. After each of his travels, he never failed to write thrilling and self-aggrandizing memoirs. However, he was also a racist, misogynist, and imperialist when racists and imperialists were striving to outdo one another.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was one of the loudest voices in the English-speaking world to spread the vicious idea that the Middle East was part of the exotic, erotic, and easily exploitable East in almost everything he translated. The Sanskrit Kama Sutra, for example, was intended as a vehicle to expose his Victorian audiences to the kinky sexual practices of other cultures and, above all, the flash about his erudition. Thus, it is nearly impossible to talk about One Thousand and One Nights without discussing the blatant and destructive Orientalist project that plagues it.</p>
<p>In the Orientalist tradition, Americans and western Europeans often portrayed the East as exotic and enigmatic while simultaneously judging and romanticizing it without ever understanding it. Deep down, the “translators” like Galland felt their values were justified. After all, Galland was an elitist. His distaste for the lifestyle of the “others” affirmed his perspective. Thus, scholars like him published reports, collections, and translations portraying the East as raucous, uncultured, and unintelligent because these “other” cultures deviated from their values. Said went further; he thought Western scholarship held strong ties to the domineering, imperialist societies that produced it, concluding that much Western scholarship about Middle Eastern and Asian cultures was inherently political and intellectually dubious. Said argued that stereotyping became justification for Western colonization of Middle Eastern and Asian countries. The West painted a picture of an Eastern world that needed civilizing. The invasion was framed as salvation, rescuing the inhabitants who were too lazy and too pleasure-focused to be fit to govern themselves. So, we can deduce that either the West was blind to its failings and did not recognize its portrayal of the East as stereotyping, or it believed that its own culture was superior. Edward Said’s book became the foundational text for postcolonial studies and transformed Middle Eastern and Asian Studies. His theory remains critically relevant today, so much so that it has become part of our language. The term Orientalism describes a patronizing Western attitude towards other cultures from the Middle East and Asia. So, Scheherazade has her work cut out for her; not only must she deconstruct the misogyny inherent in patriarchy but also the Orientalist project that robs her of her agency yet again.</p>
<p>The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale</p>
<div class="image-placeholder" style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;"><em>[Image Intended: A Middle English Edition of Canterbury Tales]</em></div>
<p>The Wife of Bath’s Tale is referring to an Arthurian Romance. The “tale” recaptures the historic days of Arthur, and it is the only actual example of Arthurian romance that Chaucer wrote. He was attracted to Romance and displayed his appreciation for the genre throughout his other tales, but he only wrote the one Arthurian Romance, which he then assigned to the Wife of Bath! Alyson’s tale uses a standard convention of the Romance genre, opening with a juxtaposition between the “now” of the text (late Medieval) and the past that it depicts (Arthurian). We will often see and hear nostalgic statements about bygone eras, like the tried and true “love was different back in my day.” This, of course, implies that the present time is somehow deficient; for instance, the friar seeing a woman in a position of power as an example of how the current society was corrupt. Chaucer employs a pretty standard convention of Romance; however, he renders that cliché form specifically to support the tale and its narrator, the wife.</p>
<p>So, the Wife of Bath tells us that in Arthur’s days, the whole land was full of the fanciful, supernatural, and faery world. In contrast, the presence of Friars essentially means that the culture of the friars has permanently displaced the Faery lands; where the elf used to walk, now the friar walks. She tells us that Friars are “as thick as…”  These descriptions help communicate the sense that they are everywhere. These Friars get into every single space, and it accomplishes the satirical jab in a more poetic and resonant manner than saying friars are everywhere.</p>
<p>At the same time, this digressive moment for the Wife of Bath indicates her engagement in anti-fraternal satire. These satirical attacks on the Friars were also a prevalent mode of writing in the 14th century. Indeed, she is picking up on some mainstays of this kind of anti-fraternal satire. So, the idea of Friars being as thick as specks of dust in the sunlight is ironic given that Friars have often likened this kind of satirical writing to things like flies and bees. Chaucer’s contemporary William Langland writes about a figure called the friar, which he gave the name Sir Penetrans-Domos, meaning the penetrating of the home. So, Chaucer combines anti-fraternal satire and a conventional element of Romance, the juxtaposition of the past and the contemporary. However, he renders it sharply pointed at this moment because it is part of the Wife of Bath’s attack on the Friar, and it contributes to the roadside drama of The Canterbury Tales.</p>
<p>The Wife of Bath’s Tale is also, of course, an example of the loathly lady stereotype, and this is a stereotype that was pervasive in the Middle English tradition and literature from the Middle Ages. However, it is also indicative of the overall abjection of women in this period of world history. It is helpful to juxtapose these different versions to get a sense of what is distinctive in Chaucer’s rendition. There are two I want to focus on. One is known as The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle. This middle English tale features Sir Gawain, Arthur’s nephew, one of the critical Knights of the Arthurian World, and his marriage to the Loathly Lady. The other is called The Tale of Florent, and it forms part of the collection Confessio Amantis, a collection of tales written by John Gower, Chaucer’s friend and contemporary. In both of these versions, Gawain’s romance and the tale of Sir Florent follow a similar pattern. Gawain and Sir Florent both have the quest to find what women most desire. They get the answer in return for marrying the Loathly Lady. On the wedding night, they are given a choice: How will they have her in the future? They can either have the loathsome woman be beautiful by day but ugly by night or ugly by day and beautiful by night. It is a choice between whether they will prioritize private desire, personal satisfaction, and fulfillment, or their public reputations. By handing the sovereignty over to the Loathly Lady and allowing her to choose, they are rewarded by her magical transformation, as it turns out that this was all an enchantment that was placed on her by her stepmother.</p>
<p>That is, of course, how this trope works in other works mentioned. Chaucer, however, makes several significant contributions to this type of tale. In Chaucer’s version, neither the Knight nor the Loathly Lady, where she is only ever called the old lady, is ever named. They are not given names. Secondly, he makes a particular action of the knight the crime of rape, and therefore the connection between the crime and the punishment is more explicit. He committed rape, and he must now go and find out what it is that women most desire. Next, he does not give any explicit details of the “loathness” of the Loathly Lady. For the other writers I have mentioned, they devote quite many lines to describe how hideous she was, and contemporary authors enjoy doing this. Chaucer says,</p>
<p>Thou art so loothly, and so oold also,</p>
<p>Thou art so loathsome, and so old also,</p>
<p>1101       And therto comen of so lough a kynde,</p>
<p>And moreover descended from such low born lineage,</p>
<p>1102       That litel wonder is thogh I walwe and wynde.</p>
<p>That little wonder is though I toss and twist about.</p>
<p>1103       So wolde God myn herte wolde breste!"</p>
<p>So would God my heart would burst!"</p>
<p>you could not imagine or describe a fouler creature. He uses inexpressibility tropes here to describe just how ugly she is. Now Romance is full of these kinds of inexpressibility tropes, but they are usually employed to describe the beauty of heroin. Chaucer inverts the trope to describe the loathness of the older woman.</p>
<p>The last thing Chaucer does is to make the Knight’s reservation and hesitation on his wedding night not just about how ugly she is but also about her social status. She has come from so low a status, which is part of what makes the Knight toss and turn in bed and distress. Through the older woman as a representative of the “lower class,” Chaucer redefines what gentility meant through her speech. Gentility means both nobility of one’s rank and the status and the nobility of one’s character in the Middle English sense. The older woman’s speech comprises a quarter of the Tale's length and is one hundred lines long. Thus, it is meant to be taken seriously. The older woman, in her arguments, detaches the nobility of rank from the quality of nobility of character when it comes to her gentility. This subject has already been interrogated by romance because, after all, we have a Knight who commits the crime of rape. However, in her speech, she clarifies that they do not necessarily reside in the same person. He who is noble in status is certainly not always going to be noble in character.</p>
<p>The next thing that Chaucer does is to change the nature of the choice that the Knight must make. Will he choose for her to be the ugly and old but faithful and obedient wife, or will he choose for her to become the beautiful, young, and by implication, likely to be unfaithful wife. Finally, unlike in other versions of this trope of the Romantic genre, wherein a curse is a cause for the Loathly Lady’s condition, The Wife of Bath’s Tale has no external actor inflicting this upon the older woman, now his wife. The implication here is that she can self-transform or she can shapeshift. Chaucer has created a robust and independent representative of the woman’s experience, and Alyson is heralded by many as one of English literature's first feminist figures. Through the satire of this text, Alyson articulates the core desire of the feminist movement; women want one thing: sovereignty and equal representation that perceives feminine characteristics on equal terms as masculine ones.</p>

<p>If there had been a bestseller book list in France during the late 14th century, then The Romance of the Rose would have registered as the number one bestseller for years, with translations from the original French into English, Dutch, and Italian. The poem sets out to entertain the reader as the hero tries to woo his beloved. The Romance of the Rose was widely read; it became hugely popular and was highly regarded by laymen and scholars alike. In 1401, a scholar at the French court wrote a treatise supporting the poem. Soon after, he received a letter from a little-known poet; her first letter stated:</p>
<p>I wish to say, to divulge, and to maintain openly that (saving your good grace) you are in grave error to give such lavish and unjustified praise to Meun’s book- one which could better be called plain idleness than useful work, in my judgment. (Baird 46)</p>
<p>The letter went on to say that the poem justified rape, that it deliberately slandered all women, and she asked the secretary himself if he would allow his daughters to be educated by it. Christine de Pizan’s signature was on that letter. By daring to question the representation of women in literature and, by extension, women’s place in society, Christine de Pizan rocketed into public view. For most, Pizan’s letter, penned over six hundred years ago, marks the birth of feminism.</p>
<p>may it not be imputed to me as folly, arrogance, or presumption, that I, a woman, should dare to reproach and call into question so subtle an author, and to diminish the stature of his work, when he alone, a man, has dared to undertake to defame and blame without exception an entire sex. (Baird 63)</p>
<p>Women and men face double standards, and no, we do not mean just the gender pay gap. We are specifically talking about the different words we use to describe men and women with the same characteristics. While he is described as charismatic, she is often described as bubbly. We would not describe him as an airhead; he is just simple, but she is an airhead. She is bossy, while he is assertive.</p>
<p>We have seen this throughout this text and this module. Whether it is the women of Gilgamesh’s kingdom, Briseis or Helen of the Iliad, Grendel’s mother, Ophelia, Medea, Alyson, or Scheherazade, these women of the ancient world were subjected to unfair, unjust, and inhumane treatments. The same actions that would have been praised in a man damn a woman; she is loathly and monstrous. Even in the more positive portrayal of women, such as Scheherazade and Alyson, who could reclaim some of their autonomy, the fact remains that a male agenda represents them. Combatting this misrepresentation is one of the primary purposes of Feminism: to create a feminine language, by women, for women.</p>
<p>For instance, the writer Ben Black found that the verbs most associated with the pronoun “she” in classic fiction are: shivered, wept, murmured, screamed, and married. The most commonly associated with “he” are: muttered, grinned, shouted, chuckled, and killed. Academics from the University of Illinois and the University of California analyzed over 100,000 works of fiction written between 1800 and 2010. They used an algorithm to determine the character’s gender, based only on the language used in descriptions and dialogue. These predictions were right 75% of the time for books written around 1800, but that falls to just about 65% of books written around 2000. The vocabulary used to describe women and men is becoming more blurred between genders; stereotypes like feisty are less common than they used to be. However, it is essential to remember that feminists like Christine de Pizan were not attempting to blur the lines between genders but establish them equally.</p>
<p>Feminism is a conflict theory that suggests that power in society is divided based on gender. Feminists suggest the patriarchal oppression of women exists in all sections of society: employment, home education, and media. They also suggest that the study of sociology has been almost entirely male-oriented. In other words, male theorists focused on the issues that are of concern to males. Indeed, early Feminism focused on studying female issues and the representations of women in society. However, Feminism evolved to deal with contemporary issues surrounding gender differences. This movement has a particular focus in contemporary society on the intersectionality of women’s experiences, examining differences based upon social class, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, age, religion, and geographical location, which gives Feminism a broad appeal when looking at our gender differences.</p>
<p>Christine de Pizan’s ability to predict the intellectual foundation of the Feminist movement is what makes her work so extraordinary. Pizan uses real historical examples in The Book of the City of Ladies to show how hypocritical men have unjustly oppressed women. The book is a chronicle of historic women who have contributed to society. Christine covers women as wives, mothers, and leaders; she speaks of women in the legal system, the social system, and marriage. She cleverly disguises her insight under three personas Lady Reason, Lady Rectitude, and Lady Justice. In doing so, she even manages to reclaim some of the loathly women that have been framed as monstrous, like Medea, who is condemned for acting in the same manner as countless men before her.</p>
<p>By proving her point, she denounces the credibility of some well-known men like Aristotle and Ovid for their views on women. An example of this is when Christine asked Lady Reason why Ovid attacked women so much in his books. Reason replies that Ovid was a man who led a promiscuous life with many women during his youth. Along the way, Ovid leads “others through his acts and words” to lead a life like his. His actions finally led the Romans to exile him for his promiscuity. Ovid had friends who managed to get his exile removed. However, when he stepped out, he went back to his old way of life, which led to his castration, and since he could not lead the pleasurable life he wanted to live, he began to attack women to bring everyone down to his level of misery.</p>
<p>Pizan’s book is a tangible demonstration of women’s accomplishments and their capability to act morally and prudently. It is a direct response to the devastating accounts about women that she has read, each of which cast doubt on women’s intellectual abilities, chastity, and faith in God. Nevertheless, without erasing the focus in Pizan’s work, we can also see a fundamental philosophical question in her approach: how do we know what the truth is, and how do we distinguish essence from—as Plato would say—opinions about it?</p>
<p>Christine de Pizan’s answer intriguingly anticipates another significant movement. Her methods are similar to the empirical epistemological searches of sixteenth-century Protestantism and seventeenth-century New Science: searching for truth by collecting data. Her examples of accomplished and admirable women typify what E. J. Richards calls “medieval notions of universal history” (264, n. II.22.2). Christine mixes figures from recent history, ancient history, mythology, the Bible, fictional accounts, and contemporary women. Fictional or factual, all her examples take on a mythic value, defying other authors’ claims of women’s inferiority. She sustains her pro-female position within Christianity. She claims that Christian writing includes reverence for the Virgin Mary and female saints and stands against misogyny. She also highlights the logical fallacies in misogynist reasoning. The triple woman framework invokes the Trinity, as well. Reason, Rectitude, and Justice, Christine’s three architects, also demonstrate what values and capacities are inherently human, what ties human beings to God, and what is inherently divine.</p>
