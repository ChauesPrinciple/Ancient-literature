                <h2>Background</h2>
                <div class="image-placeholder"
                    style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;">
                    <em>[Image Intended: Hamlet]</em></div>
                <p>Shakespeare (1564-1616) wrote plays during the late part of the sixteenth century and in the early
                    part of the seventeenth century. Hamlet, written around 1601, was Shakespeare’s longest play. It is
                    arguably one of his most famous tragedies. The lines from Hamlet's monologue in act three that begin
                    "To be, or not to be..." have been studied and are widely known even amongst those that are
                    otherwise unfamiliar with Shakespeare's work.</p>
                <p>Like our previous epic, <em>Beowulf</em>, this English text has some Danish influences. In fact, Saxo
                    Grammaticus and his histories, specifically <em>Historia Danica</em>, make another appearance. Saxo
                    told a similar tale, only 400 years prior. It is also understood that a popular collection of French
                    tales written by Francois de Belleforest adopted the primary story elements of Hamlet in the
                    <em>Histoires</em> <em>and</em> <em>Tragiques</em>. Hamlet was most likely performed in 1600, almost
                    exactly at the midpoint of Shakespeare’s writing career, and most of the written editions of
                    Shakespeare’s plays were written down (not composed) by his performers, not Shakespeare himself.</p>
                <p>At the time when Hamlet first appeared on stage, questions about loyalty and national security were
                    at the forefront of Elizabethan England politics. It is therefore worth taking a closer look at the
                    significance of these acts since this concept of revenge relates to very basic concerns about
                    justice and the legality of violent action, much like the “wergild” covered in <em>Beowulf</em>. The
                    difference herein, of course, is that this is now a fully Christian society; under the Tudors, the
                    move towards a more centralized understanding of power under a monarchy was developed. In this
                    conception, the monarch was positioned as divinely appointed and so too her earthly governing
                    bodies.</p>
                <p>Private revenge acts were understood at the time to be actions taken by an individual in response to
                    a wrong committed on themselves or their family group. Often these “blood feuds” would be settled by
                    a duel or other violent retributive actions. Francis Bacon describes revenge actions as a sort of
                    “wild justice,” connoting these as out of control or transgressing regulated human society. Even as
                    late as 1773, Dr. Johnson talks about revenge as “an act of passion; vengeance is justice.” This
                    seems to separate an individual’s private revenge actions (as an emotional response) from divine or
                    state “vengeance” as more clearly linked to ideas of legality (therefore “justice”).</p>
                <p>In this context, private revenge actions as linked to concepts of blood feud would be deeply
                    disruptive. In addition to the threats to public order presented by an individual seeking justice
                    for themselves, such actions presented both a theoretical and a literal challenge to Elizabeth I’s
                    legislative bodies.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, what happens when the judicial systems break down, or are shown to be unworkable?
                    What happens if you believe that those who make the laws are misguided or corrupt? In the play,
                    Hamlet grapples with his position in a corrupt court, where surveillance intrudes on individual’s
                    lives, and there is an apparent lack of justice: “Denmark is a prison” (2.2.239). Violent revenge
                    appears to be the only way to achieve resolution for his anger and frustration.</p>
                <p>Indeed, even though there were efforts to ensure it was the judicial system that handled crimes and
                    punishment, the idea of self-government was in fact so deeply embedded in the English psyche that
                    blood feud and dueling continued in England until the latter part of the century, and in Scotland
                    until well after 1600.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is home from school to mourn the death of his father, King Hamlet, who
                    died two months earlier. While he was gone, his mother, Queen Gertrude, has married his uncle,
                    Claudius. Hamlet is disgusted by the marriage of his newly widowed mother and Claudius, who is now
                    on the throne.</p>
                <p>Shortly after Hamlet’s return, a ghost appears to Horatio, Hamlet’s best friend, who thinks the
                    spirit has a likeness to the former King Hamlet. When asked to speak by Horatio, the ghost is
                    silent. Horatio asks Hamlet to wait for the ghost and see if it will speak to him. The ghost of his
                    father beckons Hamlet to follow him and reveals that his brother Claudius poisoned him in the ear.
                    Hamlet vows to avenge his father’s murder.</p>
                <p>While Hamlet has returned due to his father’s murder, Laertes, son to the King’s advisor Polonius, is
                    set to return to France. Before he leaves, he tells his sister Ophelia that she should be wary of
                    Hamlet’s affections towards her, especially given his “madness.” Polonius, on the other hand, orders
                    Ophelia to stay away from Hamlet.</p>
                <p>Hamlet’s sanity begins to be questioned by all. Claudius and Gertrude both show “concern” for
                    Hamlet’s welfare, and Polonius suggests it is due to Ophelia’s rejection of his advances. Claudius
                    and Polonius decide to spy on Hamlet and Ophelia. Claudius also employs Rosencrantz and
                    Guildenstern, two childhood friends of Hamlet, to spy on him. Hamlet, who is only pretending
                    madness, uses his keen observation to pierce the veil of their intentions.</p>
                <p>As luck would have it, a troupe of actors happens to be in town, and Hamlet utilizes them to
                    determine the validity of his father’s murder. He has them perform the exact act of murder that
                    Claudius used on his father, killing a king through poison in the ear. Hamlet asks Horatio to watch
                    Claudius’ reaction throughout the play. While the court is watching, Claudius is enraged and leaves
                    the play, which convinces Hamlet that he is the murderer.</p>
                <p>Hamlet is relieved of all doubt about Claudius’ guilt, and as he comes upon Claudius in the chapel
                    kneeling to pray, he readies himself to strike Claudius down. However, since Claudius is in the act
                    of prayer and will therefore go to heaven if he dies, Hamlet decides to wait until Claudius goes to
                    hell like Hamlet’s father before him. Shortly after leaving Claudius, Hamlet meets Gertrude in her
                    room, and an argument ensues. When he hears Polonius, who is hiding behind the curtain, shouts for
                    help, he stabs him thinking it is Claudius. </p>
                <p>Claudius demands that Hamlet, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern head for England while having sent a
                    letter with them ordering Hamlet’s execution during the trip. While at sea, however, Hamlet
                    discovers his planned murder and switches the orders, causing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to be
                    executed. Hamlet returns to Denmark.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, back at Elsinore, Ophelia has gone mad with grief. Laertes returns from France and learns
                    it was Hamlet who has killed his father, Polonius. Ophelia dies soon afterward, after one final
                    display of “madness.” Claudius suggests to Laertes that he duel with Hamlet and poison the tip of
                    his foil for a fatal blow and revenge. Claudius also puts poison into a drink for Hamlet just in
                    case Laertes fails. Gertrude enters and announces that Ophelia has drowned.</p>
                <p>In the graveyard, Hamlet reminisces on a friend of his whose skull he has found. When the
                    processional arrives with Ophelia’s corpse, Laertes and Hamlet quarrel, and the duel is scheduled.
                    Then, during the fight, Gertrude accidentally drinks from the poisoned chalice and dies. Hamlet is
                    wounded with the poisoned sword, but it is a small wound; in the scuffle, the foils are swapped, and
                    Laertes is also wounded with the poisoned foil. In dying, Laertes confesses Claudius’ plot to kill
                    Hamlet. Hamlet stabs Claudius, forces him to drink the rest of the poisoned chalice that killed his
                    mother, and dies asking Horatio to tell his story. The Norwegian forces arrive at Elsinore, and
                    Prince Fortinbras seizes control of Denmark.</p>

                    style="background:#f9f9f9; padding:1.5rem; text-align:center; margin:1.5rem 0; border:2px dashed #ccc; color:#666;">
                    <em>[Image Intended: The First Folio]</em></div>
                <p><em>Hamlet</em> may not seem like an obvious choice for this chapter on warriors. He is notorious for
                    his inaction, right? By some, maybe, but let us dig a bit deeper into the action of the play, and
                    whether Hamlet is truly as fickle as he has been accused. It is the position of this analysis that
                    he is acting rationally; he is also the first model of the modern existential dilemma that we, and
                    <strong>our soldiers</strong>, face.</p>
                <p>In most of our texts, we are dealing with honor-based societies. This is true for <em>Gilgamesh</em>,
                    the <em>Iliad</em>, <em>Beowulf</em>, the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, but distinctly not the <em>Song of
                        Roland</em> or <em>Hamlet</em>, which fall under the Guilt Culture Area. In <em>Beowulf</em> and
                    the <em>Song of Roland</em>, we see the bookending of the transitional period between the
                    honor-based warrior culture and the modern guilt-based Christian society of our modern world. The
                    latter being the beginning, and the former being the conclusion of this process, both of which mark
                    the conversion of the Germanic societal norms. <em>Hamlet</em>, on the other hand, shows us the
                    inherent internal conflict of the modern person: is the warrior ethos of revenge or the Christian
                    ethos of forgiveness of higher-order concern?</p>
                <p>Naturally, to explore this internal conflict, we will need to define some terms of the mind, ala
                    <strong>psychoanalysis</strong>:</p>

                </div>

                <p>The superego is the primary culprit that we are concerned about within this analysis. In introductory
                    courses, the id, ego, and superego are often presented in simplistic terms: with the id as the
                    “devil on one shoulder” and the superego as “the angel on the other shoulder.” This is only true,
                    however, <strong>if our intuition is always wrong, and society is always right</strong>. Certainly,
                    we can agree this is not the case.</p>
                <p>Our discontent in civilization arises not because of a heightening of our sense of guilt but rather
                    through the heightening of the unconscious need for punishment that defends against the sense of
                    guilt. It is beneficial to reflect on the <em>Song of Roland</em> and Dr. Shay’s assessment of
                    REMFs, to understand how social structures can stand in the way of a soldier’s ability to feel guilt
                    (or rather, <strong>even to admit they should feel guilt</strong>).</p>
                <p>What would happen if our “conscience” (our internal morality) and “ego ideal” (what people we respect
                    say is moral) are in conflict?</p>
                <p>Since most of us do not possess the strength of character for conscious suppression and self-mastery
                    without lying to ourselves, most people, including our soldiers, will be forced to fall back on
                    <strong>repression</strong>, with the disguised return of the repressed that repression itself
                    inevitably entails. Those are some ten-dollar words, but think of it like this:</p>
                <p>Example Soldier Story</p>
                <p>The disguised return of the repressed guilt is often manifested in the form of the
                    <strong>sadistic</strong> superego redirecting the id’s aggression away from the object world (e.g.
                    the REMFs who contradicted the moral code) and against the ego (ourselves). This results in various
                    forms of self-punishment; Freud described the “moral masochism” in terms of “the criminal from a
                    sense of guilt,” “those wrecked by success,” and other self-sabotaging and self-tormenting
                    character-types.</p>
                <p>Do we see this illustrated in Shakespeare’s work when we apply Dr. Shay’s viewpoint? Without
                    recognizing the feeling of guilt, a subject’s unconscious superego frequently judges him or her to
                    be guilty. Frequently, instead of allowing oneself to feel guilty (whether such guilt is justified
                    or not is another matter), the subject (the soldier, or in this case, Hamlet) often unconsciously
                    seeks external punishment unrelated to the actual offense committed (e.g., alcoholism or even
                    suicide).</p>
                <p>The feeling of guilt that might accompany the state of being guilty, or being capable of judging
                    oneself to be guilty, is absent because this feeling of guilt is unbearable or unacceptable, and in
                    many ways, we have not seen a character who struggles with such a modern dilemma. It was not morally
                    “wrong” for Achilles to slay Hector; it was tragic. Nor was it “illegal” for Beowulf to face the
                    dragon, but the lack of belief and support led to his demise. For Hamlet, the death of his father
                    demands vengeance, but <em>it is also immoral for him to kill as a modern Christian man</em>.</p>
                <p>So, first, let us tackle the subject of Hamlet’s “failure to act.” Herein, we need to look at three
                    key scenes: Hamlet slaying Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Hamlet slaying Polonius, and ultimately the
                    “ineffectual” scene where Hamlet fails to kill his uncle Claudius while Claudius is praying. I know
                    it may seem strange to go in reverse chronological order, but it helps to understand Hamlet’s
                    mindset. First, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s death are the clearest example of Hamlet’s
                    overarching sense of vengeance and capability for cruelty. When he finds the letter demanding his
                    own death upon arrival in England, he does not hesitate to have his former friends take his place in
                    death. Likewise, when Hamlet confronts his mother in her chambers, and he believes that it is his
                    uncle behind the tapestry, Hamlet does not hesitate for a moment; he stabs Polonius without even
                    checking to see who is truly hiding there. These two scenes do not paint a picture of a man who is
                    afraid of violence, cruelty, or action.</p>
                <p>So, why does he fail to kill Claudius when he has the chance? Hamlet himself tells us:</p>
                <p>He took my father grossly, full of bread,With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;And how his
                    audit stands who knows save heaven.But in our circumstance and course of thought’Tis heavy with him.
                    And am I then revengedTo take him in the purging of his soul,When he is fit and seasoned for his
                    passage?No. (92)</p>
                <p>Hamlet is concerned with justice, especially with respect to his <strong>guilt-driven
                        culture</strong>. The punishment must be fair, or at least feel fair. This does not reflect an
                    inability to act; it reflects a complex rumination on the justness of Claudius’ death.</p>
                <p>So, what does all of this have to do with guilt, soldiers or others who have PTSD, and the repressed
                    desire for punishment? I know this has gotten complex, but we will use Hamlet to bring it all
                    together. It is stated that:</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, evading guilt-feeling in this way precludes the rational evaluation of such guilt that
                    would enable us to decide whether to accept and make reparation for our actions or to reject it as
                    irrational and unfounded. One may not be guilty at all, but the repression of guilt stops that
                    judgment from ever taking place.</p>
                <p>This modern moral dilemma is played out in the most famous <strong>soliloquy</strong>:</p>
                <p>To be or not to be—that is the question:Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and
                    arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troublesAnd, by opposing, end them. To
                    die, to sleep—</p>
                <p>…</p>
                <p>To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there’s the rub,For in that sleep of death what dreams may
                    come,When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause. There’s the respectThat makes
                    calamity of so long life.For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the
                    proud man’s contumely,The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,The insolence of office, and the
                    spurnsThat patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,When he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare
                    bodkin?…</p>
                <p>…</p>
                <p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,And thus the native hue of resolutionIs sicklied o’er
                    with the pale cast of thought,And enterprises of great pitch and momentWith this regard their
                    currents turn awryAnd lose the name of action. —</p>
                <p>The central question here is one we are all familiar with: While it feels <em>right</em> and
                    <em>fair</em> to do something, it is wrong or against the law; therefore, <em>we do not act</em>.
                    Does our inaction make us all ineffectual or incapable of acting? No. However, it does highlight the
                    need for repression and how such a conflict results in someone, like a soldier who has PTSD,
                    punishing themselves even when they are not guilty. Like Hamlet, to kill a good, god-fearing man who
                    is free of sin (this is how Hamlet would have seen Claudius after prayer), even in service of one’s
                    country, would feel wrong, as would killing a town full of civilians, as noted in previous chapters.
                </p>
                <p>Unlike Hamlet, the soldiers exampled above did act. As noted in the “Betrayal of What’s Right,” the
                    schism between doing something they knew was morally wrong and being rewarded for that action led to
                    the downward spiral that PTSD represents. Such repressed guilt cannot be recognized, so it unleases
                    in other ways. For Hamlet, it is the sabotaging of his relationship with Ophelia. For soldiers, it
                    is often manifested in alcoholism, nightmares, and suicide.</p>
                <p>I cannot transition into the next module on women without speaking up for the women in Shakespeare’s
                    most famous tragedy. First, Ophelia, the tragic heroine, is often seen as having no agency. While it
                    is true that she has very little and that she is treated rather poorly, there is more to her scenes
                    than may meet the eye. Specifically, in Act Four, Scene Five, when Ophelia states:</p>
                <p>There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance. Pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies, that’s for
                    thoughts. … There’s fennel for you, and columbines. There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me; we
                    may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. You must wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I
                    would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died. They say he made a good end.
                    (Sings. For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.)</p>
                <p>This, perhaps, sounds like madness to us; but, consider poor Ophelia and how much she can or cannot
                    say in her position without punishment, especially by a King or Queen, who is willing to kill their
                    own son. For a little context, in English history, especially around the Elizabethan era, flowers
                    had a great deal of symbolism:</p>

                <ul class="glossary-list">
                    <li><strong>Rosemary and Pansies</strong>: Ophelia gives these flowers to Laertes; she even cites
                        them as being for remembrance and thoughts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fennel and Columbine</strong>: To King Claudius, Ophelia delivers a bold message: Fennel
                        is the symbol for flattery, and columbine is considered the flower for “deceived lovers,” a
                        symbol of male adultery and faithlessness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rue</strong>: Rue is the symbol for bitterness, thought to be the cause of most
                        abortions in that day, and often connected with adultery. Ophelia gives this flower to Queen
                        Gertrude, as well as keeping some for herself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Daisy</strong>: Ophelia picks up and sets down the daisy without giving it to anyone.
                        This is interesting because the daisy is the symbol of innocence and gentleness. Evidently,
                        Ophelia thought there was no place for innocence in the Danish court anymore.</li>
                    <li><strong>Violets</strong>: Finally, Ophelia says that she would have brought violets but that
                        they all withered when her father died. This is a fascinating note for Ophelia to close on
                        because violets are the symbol of faithfulness and fidelity.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In her own way, Ophelia was calling out everyone in the room for what they were. Curiously, however,
                    Claudius does not seem to get the worst of it. Gertrude is being accused of adultery, bitterness,
                    and abortion. It is as if Ophelia is telling Gertrude that she knows Gertrude tried to kill her own
                    son. Furthermore, consider Ophelia’s lines just before the latter passage:</p>
                <p>You must sing “A-down a-down”—and you “Call him a-down-a.”—O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the
                    false steward that stole his master’s daughter. Down, down, it is the false steward that stole his
                    master’s daughter.</p>
                <p>It begs the question, who is the falsest person in the play? It is the traditional viewpoint that
                    Claudius is the mastermind and antagonist of this play, but I challenge that this may be due to the
                    focus on Hamlet as someone who suffers from Oedipus complex. That is, Hamlet’s reluctance to kill
                    Claudius is thought to be rooted in the Oedipus complex, a Freudian concept of a child’s rivalry or
                    opposition towards his father due to his unconscious psychosexual affection towards his mother. If,
                    however, Hamlet’s failure to act is instead due to the conflict within his superego, then this is
                    not true. Furthermore, if we examine Claudius’ prayer scene a little more closely, it is strange
                    that he feels such remorse <em>if it were his plan to kill his brother</em>. Shakespeare does not
                    shy away from a strong woman antagonist, see lady Macbeth, and it is worth considering that right
                    after Ophelia makes this pronouncement, she “dies” by “possible suicide” when climbing on a branch,
                    and the Queen watches as she slowly sinks and her dress slowly splays out in the stream. Gertrude
                    does not mention attempting to save Ophelia even once.</p>
                <p>Perhaps she wanted a man she could control.</p>
