                </p>

                <p>Shakespeare (1564-1616) wrote plays during the late part of the sixteenth century and in the early
                    part of the seventeenth century. <em>Hamlet</em>, written around <strong>1600-1601</strong>, was
                    Shakespeare’s longest play. It is arguably one of his most famous tragedies. The lines from Hamlet's
                    monologue in Act Three that begin <strong>"To be, or not to be..."</strong> have been studied and
                    are widely known even amongst those that are otherwise unfamiliar with Shakespeare's work.</p>
                <p>Like our previous epic, <em>Beowulf</em>, this English text has some Danish influences. In fact, Saxo
                    Grammaticus, a Danish historian, recorded an earlier version of the Hamlet story in his
                    <em><strong>Gesta Danorum</strong></em> (Deeds of the Danes) written around <strong>1200
                        AD</strong>. Saxo's work tells a similar tale almost 400 years prior to Shakespeare’s version.
                    Additionally, <strong>François de Belleforest</strong>, in his <em><strong>Histoires
                            Tragiques</strong></em> (1570), expanded on the story and added psychological depth, which
                    likely influenced Shakespeare's <em>Hamlet</em>. The play was most likely performed in 1600, almost
                    exactly at the midpoint of Shakespeare’s writing career, and most of the written editions of
                    Shakespeare’s plays were written down (not composed) by his performers, not Shakespeare himself.
                </p>
                <p>At the time when <em>Hamlet</em> first appeared on stage, questions about loyalty and national
                    security were at the forefront of <strong>Elizabethan England</strong> politics. It is, therefore,
                    worth taking a closer look at the significance of these acts since this concept of revenge relates
                    to very basic concerns about justice and the legality of violent action, much like the
                    <strong>“wergild”</strong> (man-price) covered in <em>Beowulf</em>. The difference here, of course,
                    is that this is now a fully Christian society; under the Tudors, the move towards a more centralized
                    understanding of power under a monarchy was developed. In this conception, the monarch was
                    positioned as divinely appointed, and so too, were her earthly governing bodies.
                </p>
                <p>Private revenge acts were understood at the time to be actions taken by an individual in response to
                    a wrong committed on themselves or their family group. Often these “blood feuds” would be settled by
                    a duel or other violent retributive actions. <strong>Francis Bacon</strong> describes revenge
                    actions as a sort of <strong>“wild justice”</strong>, connoting these as out of control or
                    transgressing regulated human society. Even as late as <strong>1773</strong>, <strong>Dr.
                        Johnson</strong> talks about revenge as “an act of passion; vengeance is justice.” This seems to
                    separate an individual’s private revenge actions (as an emotional response) from divine or state
                    “vengeance” as more clearly linked to ideas of legality (therefore “justice”).</p>
                <p>In this context, private revenge actions as linked to concepts of blood feud would be deeply
                    disruptive. In addition to the threats to public order presented by an individual seeking justice
                    for themselves, such actions presented both a theoretical and a literal challenge to
                    <strong>Elizabeth I’s</strong> legislative bodies.
                </p>
                <p>On the other hand, what happens when the judicial systems break down or are shown to be unworkable?
                    What happens if you believe that those who make the laws are misguided or corrupt? In the play,
                    Hamlet grapples with his position in a corrupt court, where surveillance intrudes on individuals’
                    lives, and there is an apparent lack of justice: <strong>“Denmark is a prison”</strong>
                    (<em>2.2.239</em>). Violent revenge appears to be the only way to achieve a resolution for his anger
                    and frustration.</p>
                <p>Indeed, even though there were efforts to ensure it was the judicial system that handled crimes and
                    punishment, the idea of self-government was so deeply embedded in the English psyche that blood
                    feuds and dueling continued in England until the latter part of the century, and in Scotland until
                    well after <strong>1600</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><strong>Hamlet</strong>, Prince of Denmark, is home from school to mourn the death of his father,
                    King Hamlet, who died two months earlier. While he was gone, his mother, <strong>Queen
                        Gertrude</strong>, has married his uncle, <strong>Claudius</strong>. Hamlet is disgusted by the
                    marriage of his newly widowed mother and Claudius, who is now on the throne.</p>
                <p>Shortly after Hamlet’s return, a ghost appears to <strong>Horatio</strong>, Hamlet’s best friend, who
                    thinks the spirit has a likeness to the former King Hamlet. When asked to speak by Horatio, the
                    ghost is silent. Horatio asks Hamlet to wait for the ghost and see if it will speak to him. The
                    ghost of his father beckons Hamlet to follow him and reveals that his brother
                    <strong>Claudius</strong> poisoned him in the ear. Hamlet vows to avenge his father’s murder.
                </p>
                <p>While Hamlet has returned due to his father’s murder, <strong>Laertes</strong>, son to the King’s
                    advisor <strong>Polonius</strong>, is set to return to France. Before he leaves, he tells his sister
                    <strong>Ophelia</strong> that she should be wary of Hamlet’s affections towards her, especially
                    given his “madness.” Polonius, on the other hand, orders Ophelia to stay away from Hamlet.
                </p>
                <p>Hamlet’s sanity begins to be questioned by all. Claudius and Gertrude both show “concern” for
                    Hamlet’s welfare, and Polonius suggests it is due to Ophelia’s rejection of his advances. Claudius
                    and Polonius decide to spy on Hamlet and Ophelia. Claudius also employs <strong>Rosencrantz and
                        Guildenstern</strong>, two childhood friends of Hamlet, to spy on him. Hamlet, who is only
                    pretending madness, uses his keen observation to pierce the veil of their intentions.</p>
                <p>As luck would have it, a troupe of actors happens to be in town, and Hamlet utilizes them to
                    determine the validity of his father’s murder. He has them perform the exact act of murder that
                    Claudius used on his father, killing a king through poison in the ear. Hamlet asks Horatio to watch
                    Claudius’ reaction throughout the play. While the court is watching, Claudius is enraged and leaves
                    the play, which convinces Hamlet that he is the murderer.</p>
                <p>Hamlet is relieved of all doubt about Claudius’ guilt, and as he comes upon Claudius in the chapel
                    kneeling to pray, he readies himself to strike Claudius down. However, since Claudius is in the act
                    of prayer and will therefore go to heaven if he dies, Hamlet decides to wait until Claudius goes to
                    hell like Hamlet’s father before him. Shortly after leaving Claudius, Hamlet meets Gertrude in her
                    room, and an argument ensues. When he hears Polonius, who is hiding behind the curtain, shouts for
                    help, he stabs him thinking it is Claudius.</p>
                <p>Claudius demands that Hamlet, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern head for England while having sent a
                    letter with them ordering Hamlet’s execution during the trip. While at sea, however, Hamlet
                    discovers his planned murder and switches the orders, causing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to be
                    executed. Hamlet returns to Denmark.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, back at Elsinore, Ophelia has gone mad with grief. Laertes returns from France and learns
                    it was Hamlet who has killed his father, Polonius. Ophelia dies soon afterward, after one final
                    display of “madness.” Claudius suggests to Laertes that he duel with Hamlet and poison the tip of
                    his foil for a fatal blow and revenge. Claudius also puts poison into a drink for Hamlet just in
                    case Laertes fails. Gertrude enters and announces that Ophelia has drowned.</p>
                <p>In the graveyard, Hamlet reminisces on a friend of his whose skull he has found. When the
                    processional arrives with Ophelia’s corpse, Laertes and Hamlet quarrel, and the duel is scheduled.
                    Then, during the fight, Gertrude accidentally drinks from the poisoned chalice and dies. Hamlet is
                    wounded with the poisoned sword, but it is a small wound; in the scuffle, the foils are swapped, and
                    Laertes is also wounded with the poisoned foil. In dying, Laertes confesses Claudius’ plot to kill
                    Hamlet. Hamlet stabs Claudius, forces him to drink the rest of the poisoned chalice that killed his
                    mother, and dies asking Horatio to tell his story. The <strong>Norwegian forces</strong> arrive at
                    Elsinore, and <strong>Prince Fortinbras</strong> seizes control of Denmark.</p>
