                <p>Popol Vuh Twins</p>
                <p><em>The Popol Vuh</em>, or Popol Wuj in the K’iche’ language, is the creation story of the Maya.
                    <em>The Popol Vuh</em> is a foundational and sacred narrative of the Kʼicheʼ people from long before
                    the Spanish conquest of Mexico. One translation of the text is: “Book of the Community,” which
                    narrates the Maya creation account including the tales of the Hero Twins and the K’iche genealogies.
                </p>
                <p>In the K’iche region of present-day Guatemala, around 1550, an unnamed Maya scribe wrote down his
                    culture's creation myths. He wrote in the K’iche language using the modern Spanish alphabet. The
                    book was treasured by the people of the town of Chichicastenango, and it was hidden from the
                    Spanish, who had burned many of their texts. In 1701, a Spanish priest named Francisco Ximénez
                    gained the trust of the community. They allowed him to see the book, and he dutifully copied it into
                    a history account he was writing around 1715. He copied the K’iche text and translated it into
                    Spanish as he did so.</p>
                <p>In its original form, the work was a single, long poem. It was only divided into separate books once
                    it was translated into European languages. The intention of the original author seems to have been
                    to preserve the experience of hearing the poem recited and to experience the events personally as
                    the tale unfolded. This practice is in keeping with oral traditions in other cultures such as those
                    of ancient Greece and Mesopotamia, among others.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><em>The Popol Vuh</em> is the Mayan story of creation as well as the Hero Twins and their victory
                    over the Lords of Xibalba (the underworld). It begins with the origin of everything that is and
                    proceeds to the account of this dramatic conflict. Explanations of the creation of humans, animals,
                    the powers of the deities, as well as the relationships among gods, animals, and humans appear
                    during the narrative. The story of the struggle between the Hero Twins – Hunahpu (One Blowgunner)
                    and Xbalanque (Little Jaguar Sun, or Jaguar Deer), and the Lords of Xibalba also yields rich
                    characterizations of Mayan social ethics, hierarchies, and cosmology. </p>
                <p>In this story, the Creators, Heart of Sky, and six other deities, including the Feathered Serpent,
                    wanted to create human beings with hearts and minds who could “keep the days.” Their first attempt
                    to create people from mud failed. Their second attempt to make humans from wood also failed because
                    they did not have hearts and minds, and the gods destroyed them with a great flood. In the third and
                    final form, humans were created out of yellow and white maize; they could talk, worship, and glorify
                    the gods; however, there was still a problem: they were as divine as the gods. The gods decided to
                    put a fog over human eyes.</p>

                <p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
                <p>Popol Vuh, Creation</p>
                <p>Several of the works in this cluster illustrate at least a rudimentary conception of natural law
                    theory, including reference to a binding, knowable moral code that humans are obliged to follow or
                    suffer divine retribution. In the introduction to this chapter, it was mentioned that with the
                    techniques of ritual, people attempted to take firm control of the material world and at the same
                    time transcended that world by fashioning their invisible projects, which made them supernatural and
                    raised them over and above material decay and death. Ritual is a preindustrial technique of
                    manufacture. Creation myths such as <em>Works and Days</em> and <em>Popol Vuh</em> illustrate this
                    notion of ritual storytelling to create meaning.</p>
                <p><em>Works and Days</em> invoke important figures in Greek mythology, Zeus, Pandora, and Prometheus,
                    to explain why people cannot live peaceful, uncomplicated lives. Hesiod depicts Pandora as
                    accidentally bringing evil into the world rather than being evil herself. He gives another
                    explanation for the presence of evil in the world, as well, depicting humanity as gradually
                    degenerating "from the age of gold to the age of iron.”</p>
                <p>Likewise, in <em>Popol Vuh</em>, we see this process of meaning-making played out: the failed attempt
                    to create people from mud, the lack of consciousness of the people made of wood, and, ultimately,
                    the people made of maize whose purpose is made clear: our meaning is the veneration of our creators.
                    There is, however, a twist as well. Despite being the final creation, humanity requires a fog of
                    ignorance placed upon them because the gods did not want to share their divine truths; they presumed
                    we would no longer worship them if we knew.</p>
                <p>Are we better off under the Veil of Maya?</p>
