                                                For the gods keep hidden from men the means of life. Else you would
                                                easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year even
                                                without working; [45] soon would you put away your rudder over the
                                                smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste.
                                                But Zeus in the anger of his heart hid it, because Prometheus the crafty
                                                deceived him; therefore he planned sorrow and mischief against men. [50]
                                                He hid fire; but that the noble son of Iapetus stole again for men from
                                                Zeus the counsellor in a hollow fennel-stalk, so that Zeus who delights
                                                in thunder did not see it. But afterwards Zeus who gathers the clouds
                                                said to him in anger: “Son of Iapetus, surpassing all in cunning, [55]
                                                you are glad that you have outwitted me and stolen fire—a great plague
                                                to you yourself and to men that shall be. But I will give men as the
                                                price for fire an evil thing in which they may all be glad of heart
                                                while they embrace their own destruction.”</span>

                                                said the father of men and gods, and laughed aloud. [60] And he bade
                                                famous Hephaestus make haste and mix earth with water and to put in it
                                                the voice and strength of human kind, and fashion a sweet, lovely
                                                maiden-shape, like to the immortal goddesses in face; and Athena to
                                                teach her needlework and the weaving of the varied web; [65] and golden
                                                Aphrodite to shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that
                                                weary the limbs. And he charged Hermes the guide, the Slayer of Argus,
                                                to put in her a shameless mind and a deceitful nature. So he ordered.
                                                And they obeyed the lord Zeus the son of Cronos. [70] Forthwith the
                                                famous Lame God moulded clay in the likeness of a modest maid, as the
                                                son of Cronos purposed. And the goddess brighteyed Athena girded and
                                                clothed her, and the divine Graces and queenly Persuasion put necklaces
                                                of gold upon her, [75] and the rich-haired Hours crowned her head with
                                                spring flowers. And Pallas Athena bedecked her form with all manner of
                                                finery. Also the Guide, the Slayer of Argus, contrived within her lies
                                                and crafty words and a deceitful nature at the will of loud thundering
                                                Zeus, [80] and the Herald of the gods put speech in her. And he called
                                                this woman Pandora,1 because all they who dwelt on Olympus gave each a
                                                gift, a plague to men who eat bread.</span>

                                                when he had finished the sheer, hopeless snare, the Father sent glorious
                                                Argus-Slayer, [85] the swift messenger of the gods, to take it to
                                                Epimetheus as a gift. And Epimetheus did not think on what Prometheus
                                                had said to him, bidding him never take a gift of Olympian Zeus, but to
                                                send it back for fear it might prove to be something harmful to men. But
                                                he took the gift, and afterwards, when the evil thing was already his,
                                                he understood. [90] For ere this the tribes of men lived on earth remote
                                                and free from ills and hard toil and heavy sicknesses which bring the
                                                Fates upon men; for in misery men grow old quickly. But the woman took
                                                off the great lid of the jar<a

                                                [95] and scattered, all these and her thought caused sorrow and mischief
                                                to men. Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the
                                                rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the
                                                lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who
                                                gathers the clouds. [100] But the rest, countless plagues, wander
                                                amongst men; for earth is full of evils, and the sea is full. Of
                                                themselves diseases come upon men continually by day and by night,
                                                bringing mischief to mortals silently; for wise Zeus took away speech
                                                from them. [105] So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus. Or if

                                                of all [110] the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made a golden race
                                                of mortal men who lived in the time of Cronos when he was reigning in
                                                heaven. And they lived like gods [115] without sorrow of heart, remote
                                                and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with
                                                legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the
                                                reach of all evils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome
                                                with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth
                                                unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in
                                                ease and peace upon their lands with many good things, [120] rich in
                                                flocks and loved by the blessed gods. But after the earth had covered
                                                this generation—they are called pure spirits dwelling on the earth, and
                                                are kindly, delivering from harm, and guardians of mortal men; [125] for
                                                they roam everywhere over the earth, clothed in mist and keep watch on
                                                judgements and cruel deeds, givers of wealth; for this royal right also
                                                they received;—then they who dwell on Olympus made a second generation
                                                which was of silver and less noble by far. It was like the golden race
                                                neither in body nor in spirit. [130] A child was brought up at his good
                                                mother's side a hundred years, an utter simpleton, playing childishly in
                                                his own home. But when they were full grown and were come to the full
                                                measure of their prime, they lived only a little time and that in sorrow
                                                because of their foolishness, for they could not keep from sinning and
                                                [135] from wronging one another, nor would they serve the immortals, nor
                                                sacrifice on the holy altars of the blessed ones as it is right for men
                                                to do wherever they dwell. Then Zeus the son of Cronos was angry and put
                                                them away, because they would not give honor to the blessed gods who
                                                live on Olympus.</span>

                                                But when earth had covered this generation also—they are called blessed
                                                spirits of the underworld by men, and, though they are of second order,
                                                yet honor attends them also—Zeus the Father made a third generation of
                                                mortal men, a brazen race, sprung from ash-trees1 ; and it was in no way
                                                equal to the silver age, [145] but was terrible and strong. They loved
                                                the lamentable works of Ares and deeds of violence; they ate no bread,
                                                but were hard of heart like adamant, fearful men. Great was their
                                                strength and unconquerable the arms which grew from their shoulders on
                                                their strong limbs. [150] Their armor was of bronze, and their houses of
                                                bronze, and of bronze were their implements: there was no black iron.
                                                These were destroyed by their own hands and passed to the dank house of
                                                chill Hades, and left no name: terrible though they were, [155] black
                                                Death seized them, and they left the bright light of the sun. But when
                                                earth had covered this generation also, Zeus the son of Cronos made yet
                                                another, the fourth, upon the fruitful earth, which was nobler and more
                                                righteous, a god-like race of hero-men who are called [160] demi-gods,
                                                the race before our own, throughout the boundless earth. Grim war and
                                                dread battle destroyed a part of them, some in the land of Cadmus at
                                                seven-gated Thebes when they fought for the flocks of Oedipus, and some,
                                                when it had brought them in ships over the great sea gulf [165] to Troy
                                                for rich-haired Helen's sake: there death's end enshrouded a part of
                                                them. But to the others father Zeus the son of Cronos gave a living and
                                                an abode apart from men, and made them dwell at the ends of earth. [170]
                                                And they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along
                                                the shore of deep-swirling Ocean, happy heroes for whom [173] the
                                                grain-giving earth bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year,
                                                [169] far from the deathless gods, and Cronos rules over them; [169a]
                                                for the father of men and gods released him from his bonds. [169b] And
                                                these last equally have honor and glory. [169c] And again far-seeing
                                                Zeus made yet another generation, the fifth, of men [169d] who are upon

                                                Thereafter, would that I were not among the men of the fifth generation,
                                                [175] but either had died before or been born afterwards. For now truly
                                                is a race of iron, and men never rest from labor and sorrow by day, and
                                                from perishing by night; and the gods shall lay sore trouble upon them.
                                                But, notwithstanding, even these shall have some good mingled with their
                                                evils. [180] And Zeus will destroy this race of mortal men also when
                                                they come to have grey hair on the temples at their birth.1 The father
                                                will not agree with his children, nor the children with their father,
                                                nor guest with his host, nor comrade with comrade; nor will brother be
                                                dear to brother as aforetime. [185] Men will dishonor their parents as
                                                they grow quickly old, and will carp at them, chiding them with bitter
                                                words, hard-hearted they, not knowing the fear of the gods. They will
                                                not repay their aged parents the cost of their nurture, for might shall
                                                be their right: and one man will sack another's city. [190] There will
                                                be no favor for the man who keeps his oath or for the just or for the
                                                good; but rather men will praise the evil-doer and his violent dealing.
                                                Strength will be right, and reverence will cease to be; and the wicked
                                                will hurt the worthy man, speaking false words against him, and will
                                                swear an oath upon them. [195] Envy, foul-mouthed, delighting in evil,
                                                with scowling face, will go along with wretched men one and all. [200]
                                                And then Aidos and Nemesis,2 with their sweet forms wrapped in white
                                                robes, will go from the wide-pathed earth and forsake mankind to join
                                                the company of the deathless gods: and bitter sorrows will be left for
                                                mortal men, and there will be no help against evil.</span>

                                                now I will tell a fable for princes who themselves understand. Thus said
                                                the hawk to the nightingale with speckled neck, while he carried her
                                                high up among the clouds, gripped fast in his talons, [205] and she,
                                                pierced by his crooked talons, cried pitifully. To her he spoke
                                                disdainfully: “Miserable thing, why do you cry out? One far stronger
                                                than you now holds you fast, and you must go wherever I take you,
                                                songstress as you are. And if I please, I will make my meal of you, or
                                                let you go. [210] He is a fool who tries to withstand the stronger, for
                                                he does not get the mastery and suffers pain besides his shame.” So said
                                                the swiftly flying hawk, the long-winged bird. But you, Perses, listen
                                                to right and do not foster violence; for violence is bad for a poor man.
                                                [215] Even the prosperous cannot easily bear its burden, but is weighed
                                                down under it when he has fallen into delusion. The better path is to go
                                                by on the other side towards Justice; for Justice beats Outrage when she
                                                comes at length to the end of the race. But only when he has suffered
                                                does the fool learn this. For Oath keeps pace with wrong judgements.
                                                [220] There is a noise when Justice is being dragged in the way where
                                                those who devour bribes and give sentence with crooked judgements, take
                                                her. And she, wrapped in mist, follows to the city and haunts of the
                                                people, weeping, and bringing mischief to men, even to such as have
                                                driven her forth in that they did not deal straightly with her. [225]
                                                But they who give straight judgements to strangers and to the men of the
                                                land, and go not aside from what is just, their city flourishes, and the
                                                people prosper in it: Peace, the nurse of children, is abroad in their
                                                land, and all-seeing Zeus never decrees cruel war against them. [230]
                                                Neither famine nor disaster ever haunt men who do true justice; but
                                                light-heartedly they tend the fields which are all their care. The earth
                                                bears them victual in plenty, and on the mountains the oak bears acorns
                                                upon the top and bees in the midst. Their woolly sheep are laden with
                                                fleeces; [235] their women bear children like their parents. They
                                                flourish continually with good things, and do not travel on ships, for
                                                the grain-giving earth bears them fruit.</span>

                                                for those who practice violence and cruel deeds far-seeing Zeus, the son
                                                of Cronos, ordains a punishment. [240] Often even a whole city suffers
                                                for a bad man who sins and devises presumptuous deeds, and the son of
                                                Cronos lays great trouble upon the people, famine and plague together,
                                                so that the men perish away, and their women do not bear children, and
                                                their houses become few, [245] through the contriving of Olympian Zeus.
                                                And again, at another time, the son of Cronos either destroys their wide
                                                army, or their walls, or else makes an end of their ships on the sea.
                                                You princes, mark well this punishment, you also, for the deathless gods
                                                are near among men; and [250] mark all those who oppress their fellows
                                                with crooked judgements; and heed not the anger of the gods. For upon
                                                the bounteous earth Zeus has thrice ten thousand spirits, watchers of
                                                mortal men, and these keep watch on judgements and deeds of wrong [255]
                                                as they roam, clothed in mist, all over the earth. And there is virgin
                                                Justice, the daughter of Zeus, who is honored and reverenced among the
                                                gods who dwell on Olympus, and whenever anyone hurts her with lying
                                                slander, she sits beside her father, Zeus the son of Cronos, [260] and
                                                tells him of men's wicked heart, until the people pay for the mad folly
                                                of their princes who, evilly minded, pervert judgement and give sentence
                                                crookedly. Keep watch against this, you princes, and make straight your
                                                judgements, you who devour bribes; put crooked judgements altogether
                                                from your thoughts. [265] He does mischief to himself who does mischief
                                                to another, and evil planned harms the plotter most. The eye of Zeus,
                                                seeing all and understanding all, beholds these things too, if so he
                                                will, and fails not to mark what sort of justice is this that the city
                                                keeps within it. [270] Now, therefore, may neither I myself be righteous
                                                among men, nor my son—for then it is a bad thing to be righteous—if
                                                indeed the unrighteous shall have the greater right. But I think that
                                                all-wise Zeus will not yet bring that to pass.</span>

                                                you, Perses, lay up these things within your heart and [275] listen now
                                                to right, ceasing altogether to think of violence. For the son of Cronos
                                                has ordained this law for men, that fishes and beasts and winged fowls
                                                should devour one another, for right is not in them; but to mankind he
                                                gave right which proves [280] far the best. For whoever knows the right
                                                and is ready to speak it, far-seeing Zeus gives him prosperity; but
                                                whoever deliberately lies in his witness and foreswears himself, and so
                                                hurts Justice and sins beyond repair, that man's generation is left
                                                obscure thereafter. [285] But the generation of the man who swears truly
                                                is better thenceforward. To you, foolish Perses, I will speak good
                                                sense. Badness can be got easily and in shoals; the road to her is
                                                smooth, and she lives very near us. But between us and Goodness the gods
                                                have placed the sweat of our brows; [290] long and steep is the path
                                                that leads to her, and it is rough at the first; but when a man has
                                                reached the top, then is she easy to reach, though before that she was
                                                hard. [295] That man is altogether best who considers all things himself
                                                and marks what will be better afterwards and at the end; and he, again,
                                                is good who listens to a good adviser; but whoever neither thinks for
                                                himself nor keeps in mind what another tells him, he is an unprofitable
                                                man. But do you at any rate, always remembering my charge, work,
                                                high-born Perses, that Hunger [300] may hate you, and venerable Demeter
                                                richly crowned may love you and fill your barn with food; for Hunger is
                                                altogether a meet comrade for the sluggard. Both gods and men are angry
                                                with a man who lives idle, [305] for in nature he is like the stingless
                                                drones who waste the labor of the bees, eating without working; but let
                                                it be your care to order your work properly, that in the right season
                                                your barns may be full of victual. Through work men grow rich in flocks
                                                and substance, and [309] working they are much better loved by the
                                                immortals.1 [311] Work is no disgrace: it is idleness which is a
                                                disgrace. But if you work, the idle will soon envy you as you grow rich,
                                                for fame and renown attend on wealth. And whatever be your lot, work is
                                                best for you, [315] if you turn your misguided mind away from other
                                                men's property to your work and attend to your livelihood as I bid you.
                                                An evil shame is the needy man's companion, shame which both greatly
                                                harms and prospers men: shame is with poverty, but confidence with
                                                wealth.</span>
