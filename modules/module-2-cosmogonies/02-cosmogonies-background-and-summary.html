                <!-- HESIOD SECTION -->
                <h1>Hesiod: Works and Days</h1>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
                <p>Hesiod Portrait</p>
                <p><em>Works and Days</em> is one of the earliest sources of Greek religion and culture that still
                    exists. Hesiod was probably roughly contemporaneous with Homer (another author we will study) who
                    wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey. The consensus is that Hesiod was a real person; however, the works
                    attributed to Hesiod almost certainly contain additions from later writers, which represent cultural
                    ideas or things that occur after Hesiod's lifetime.</p>
                <p>Hesiod lived some time in the late 8th to mid-7th century B.C.E. B.C.E. stands for "Before Common
                    Era" and is the same as "B.C.," so remember, when we are talking about B.C. or B.C.E., the numbers
                    go backward. Autobiographical information from Hesiod from his poetry reveals to us that he was the
                    son of an immigrant to the Greek Peninsula; his father immigrated there from elsewhere. Hesiod was a
                    Shepherd by trade and lived on or near Mount Helicon where he was visited by the
                    <strong>muses</strong>: the divine beings that Greeks believed to inspire all music, art, and
                    stories. They visited him while he was working as a Shepherd and inspired him to become a poet. We
                    also know that he was successful as a poet.
                </p>
                <p><em>Works and Days</em> is a mythical history of humanity but is also a very <strong>didactic
                        poem</strong>: a poem that instructs either in terms of morals or by providing knowledge of
                    philosophy, religion, arts, science, or skills. It is about the proper ways of life and the way that
                    we should live life. It is important to note that Hesiod did not invent or originate the stories
                    mentioned in his poetry. Instead, he seems to be closer to the later period or the end of a
                    tradition. Therefore, his work is a synthesis or a combination of long-established preexisting
                    stories that people would have been familiar with. What is essential is the way he put them
                    together.</p>
                <p>In his works, he talks about the gods, so we need to know a bit about Greek religion. Greek religion
                    was <strong>polytheistic</strong> rather than <strong>monotheis</strong><strong>tic</strong> like
                    Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. Followers of the ancient Greek religion believed in multiple divine
                    or supernatural beings. The religion is also <strong>syncretic</strong> as<strong> </strong>ancient
                    Greeks combined religious traditions from many different sources and cultures that they met,
                    resulting in the existence of multiple beings associated with the same objects or ideas. For
                    example, in both Artemis and Selene, two different meanings are associated with the moon. There are
                    many other examples of this, giving way to the many different conflicts and competitions between
                    various gods over rulership. This may mirror, in some ways, the historical conflict between
                    different cultures as they came together. </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><em>Works and Days</em> is primarily a <strong>didactic</strong> poem meant to instruct morals and
                    behavior to the common person – the farmer, the worker, the everyday person. So, this is about human
                    affairs far more than it is about cosmological affairs, one of the things that differentiates it
                    from Hesiod's other work, the <em>Theogony</em>. It is a mix of moral and ethical as well as
                    practical advice. The framing of <em>Works and Days</em> is Hesiod addressing himself to Perses, his
                    dissolute wayward brother, as Perses attempted to take more than his fair share of their father's
                    inheritance by bribing the local rulers through trickery and guile. Hesiod admonishes him for his
                    lack of discipline, his laziness, and his cheating nature. While Hesiod repeatedly tries to instruct
                    him in virtue, the poem is not directed only to Perses. It is through Perses that Hesiod addresses
                    all those who wish to know right from wrong. </p>
                <p>One of the most important themes of <em>Works and Days</em> that we see early on is the decline of
                    humanity. Hesiod lists the various ages of man while saying that this present era, <em>the one in
                        which he lives</em>, is the most degraded. Humanity, to Hesiod, has lost its virtue, and as a
                    result, we must suffer and toil. Labor is what the modern man must endure, and there is no hope. The
                    great beings of the past are dead and gone, and our lot is only going to be suffering and toil with
                    no possibility of escape until death.</p>
                <p>The two cardinal virtues that Hesiod champions in <em>Works and Days</em> are <strong>justice
                    </strong>and <strong>work</strong>. He says that justice is necessary for any possibility of peace
                    and prosperity. <em>If there is prosperity without justice, there can be no peace</em>. Attempting
                    to define what justice means, Hesiod attempts to go beyond just human law and says that there is
                    some universal principle that defines justice. Work, on the other hand, is the lot of all humans
                    because of our degraded nature. We must work to survive, but there is also goodness in work. The
                    honest worker, the person who works hard, works right, and earns well through that manner, will
                    achieve blessings and glory, while the one who achieves work through cheating or violence will
                    ultimately be punished.</p>
                <p>Hesiod revisits the story of Zeus and Prometheus from his previous work,
                    <em>Theogony</em><em>,</em><em> </em>but in <em>Works and Days</em> Hesiod speaks about different
                    aspects: the focus is on Pandora, the first woman, who is sent as punishment for humanity because
                    Prometheus stole fire and gave it to humans. Furthermore, there is an excellent description of just
                    how beautiful Pandora is and the great attributes that she has all in juxtaposition with her
                    negative aspects and all the suffering that she brings into the world by opening Pandora's jar or,
                    depending on the translation, Pandora's box – a famous story that many have probably heard.
                </p>
                <p>Hesiod then moves to describe the ages of men. First, there is the Golden Age, and these human beings
                    lived a carefree life without pain or suffering. </p>
                <p>We should note that Pandora does not come until later in the ages, although it is not entirely clear
                    when she shows up.</p>
                <p>The Golden Age was all men living in peace and abundance, but for some reason, they all died. </p>
                <p>After this, we get the Silver age, the second generation of men, and they also lived carefree lives.
                    Hesiod describes these men as childlike, almost as spoiled, and he says they were very reckless and
                    violent. <em><strong>They refused to honor the gods</strong></em>, and for this, they were punished
                    and killed off. </p>
                <p>Next is the Bronze Age; these are humans of great strength and violence as well as being dreadful and
                    mighty. Their weapons and tools were all made of bronze, and he describes them as being consumed by
                    violence and warfare. </p>
                <p>The Bronze Age gives way to The Heroic Age. They are similar in many ways, but the Heroic Age is
                    better and <em>more </em><em><strong>j</strong></em><em><strong>ust</strong></em> than their Bronze
                    predecessors. These are the great heroes of Greek legend, the heroes of the <em>Iliad</em> and the
                    <em>Odyssey</em>: Achilles, Hercules, Perseus, and Odysseus.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, we get to the Iron Age, the modern world, of which Hesiod wishes he were not a member. He
                    explicitly describes how his contemporaries have declined in their morals and ethics. Neighbors do
                    not help each other; people do not honor the gods; the Kings take advantage of their subjects, and
                    subjects defy their Kings; children defy their parents, etc. This is an age of decline and loose
                    morality, and Hesiod says that this age, too, will eventually be destroyed.</p>

                <!-- POPOL VUH SECTION -->
                <h1>Popol Vuh</h1>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
                <p>Popol Vuh Twins</p>
                <p><em>The Popol Vuh</em>, or Popol Wuj in the K'iche' language, is the creation story of the Maya.
                    <em>The Popol Vuh</em> is a foundational and sacred narrative of the Kʼicheʼ people from long before
                    the Spanish conquest of Mexico. One translation of the text is: "Book of the Community," which
                    narrates the Maya creation account including the tales of the Hero Twins and the K'iche genealogies.
                </p>
                <p>In the K'iche region of present-day Guatemala, around 1550, an unnamed Maya scribe wrote down his
                    culture's creation myths. He wrote in the K'iche language using the modern Spanish alphabet. The
                    book was treasured by the people of the town of Chichicastenango, and it was hidden from the
                    Spanish, who had burned many of their texts. In 1701, a Spanish priest named Francisco Ximénez
                    gained the trust of the community. They allowed him to see the book, and he dutifully copied it into
                    a history account he was writing around 1715. He copied the K'iche text and translated it into
                    Spanish as he did so.</p>
                <p>In its original form, the work was a single, long poem. It was only divided into separate books once
                    it was translated into European languages. The intention of the original author seems to have been
                    to preserve the experience of hearing the poem recited and to experience the events personally as
                    the tale unfolded. This practice is in keeping with oral traditions in other cultures such as those
                    of ancient Greece and Mesopotamia, among others.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><em>The Popol Vuh</em> is the Mayan story of creation as well as the Hero Twins and their victory
                    over the Lords of Xibalba (the underworld). It begins with the origin of everything that is and
                    proceeds to the account of this dramatic conflict. Explanations of the creation of humans, animals,
                    the powers of the deities, as well as the relationships among gods, animals, and humans appear
                    during the narrative. The story of the struggle between the Hero Twins – Hunahpu (One Blowgunner)
                    and Xbalanque (Little Jaguar Sun, or Jaguar Deer), and the Lords of Xibalba also yields rich
                    characterizations of Mayan social ethics, hierarchies, and cosmology. </p>
                <p>In this story, the Creators, Heart of Sky, and six other deities, including the Feathered Serpent,
                    wanted to create human beings with hearts and minds who could "keep the days." Their first attempt
                    to create people from mud failed. Their second attempt to make humans from wood also failed because
                    they did not have hearts and minds, and the gods destroyed them with a great flood. In the third and
                    final form, humans were created out of yellow and white maize; they could talk, worship, and glorify
                    the gods; however, there was still a problem: they were as divine as the gods. The gods decided to
                    put a fog over human eyes.</p>

                <!-- ANALYSIS SECTION -->
                <h2>Analysis (Works and Days and Popol Vuh)</h2>
                <p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
                <p>Popol Vuh, Creation</p>
                <p>Several of the works in this cluster illustrate at least a rudimentary conception of natural law
                    theory, including reference to a binding, knowable moral code that humans are obliged to follow or
                    suffer divine retribution. In the introduction to this chapter, it was mentioned that with the
                    techniques of ritual, people attempted to take firm control of the material world and at the same
                    time transcended that world by fashioning their invisible projects, which made them supernatural and
                    raised them over and above material decay and death. Ritual is a preindustrial technique of
                    manufacture. Creation myths such as <em>Works and Days</em> and <em>Popol Vuh</em> illustrate this
                    notion of ritual storytelling to create meaning.</p>
                <p><em>Works and Days</em> invoke important figures in Greek mythology, Zeus, Pandora, and Prometheus,
                    to explain why people cannot live peaceful, uncomplicated lives. Hesiod depicts Pandora as
                    accidentally bringing evil into the world rather than being evil herself. He gives another
                    explanation for the presence of evil in the world, as well, depicting humanity as gradually
                    degenerating "from the age of gold to the age of iron."</p>
                <p>Likewise, in <em>Popol Vuh</em>, we see this process of meaning-making played out: the failed attempt
                    to create people from mud, the lack of consciousness of the people made of wood, and, ultimately,
                    the people made of maize whose purpose is made clear: our meaning is the veneration of our creators.
                    There is, however, a twist as well. Despite being the final creation, humanity requires a fog of
                    ignorance placed upon them because the gods did not want to share their divine truths; they presumed
                    we would no longer worship them if we knew.</p>
                <p>Are we better off under the Veil of Maya?</p>
