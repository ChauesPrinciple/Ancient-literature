<h3><span>The First Book</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Over a universe wrapped in the gloom of a dense and primeval night passed the god Hurakan, the mighty wind. He called out “earth,” and the solid land appeared. The chief gods took counsel; they were Hurakan, Gucumatz, the serpent covered with green feathers, and Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, the mother and father gods. As the result of their deliberations animals were created. But as yet <span style="font-size: 12pt;">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt;">10</a>]</span>man was not. To supply the deficiency the divine beings resolved to create mannikins carved out of wood. But these soon incurred the displeasure of the gods, who, irritated by their lack of reverence, resolved to destroy them. Then by the will of Hurakan, the Heart of Heaven, the waters were swollen, and a great flood came upon the mannikins of wood. They were drowned and a thick resin fell from heaven. The bird Xecotcovach tore out their eyes; the bird Camulatz cut off their heads; the bird Cotzbalam devoured their flesh; the bird Tecumbalam broke their bones and sinews and ground them into powder. Because they had not thought on Hurakan, therefore the face of the earth grew dark, and a pouring rain commenced, raining by day and by night. Then all sorts of beings, great and small, gathered together to abuse the men to their faces. The very household utensils and animals jeered at them, their mill-stones, their plates, their cups, their dogs, their hens. Said the dogs and hens, “Very badly have you treated us, and you have bitten us. Now we bite you in turn.” Said the mill-stones (metates<a id="xd26e196src" href="#xd26e196" name="xd26e196src">2</a>), “Very much were we tormented by you, and daily, daily, night and day, it was <i>squeak</i>, <i>screech</i>, <i>screech</i>,<a id="xd26e209src" href="#xd26e209" name="xd26e209src">3</a> for <span style="font-size: 12pt;">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt;">11</a>]</span>your sake. Now you shall feel our strength, and we will grind your flesh and make meal of your bodies.” And the dogs upbraided the mannikins because they had not been fed, and tore the unhappy images with their teeth. And the cups and dishes said, “Pain and misery you gave us, smoking our tops and sides, cooking us over the fire, burning and hurting us as if we had no feeling. Now it is your turn, and you shall burn.” Then ran the mannikins hither and thither in despair. They climbed to the roofs of the houses, but the houses crumbled under their feet; they tried to mount to the tops of the trees, but the trees hurled them from them; they sought refuge in the caverns, but the caverns closed before them. Thus was accomplished the ruin of this race, destined to be overthrown. And it is said that their posterity are the little monkeys who live in the woods.</p>

<h3><span>The Third Book</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The beginning of the third book finds the gods once more in council. In the darkness they <span style="font-size: 12pt;">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt;">24</a>]</span>commune concerning the creation of man. The Creator and Former made four perfect men. These beings were wholly created from yellow and white maize. Their names were Balam-Quitzé (Tiger with the Sweet Smile), Balam-Agab (Tiger of the Night), Mahucutah (The Distinguished Name), and Iqi-Balam (Tiger of the Moon). They had neither father nor mother, neither were they made by the ordinary agents in the work of creation. Their creation was a miracle of the Former.<a id="xd26e313src" href="#xd26e313" name="xd26e313src">6</a></p>
<p>But Hurakan was not altogether satisfied with his handiwork. These men were too perfect<span id="xd26e318" title="Not in source">.</span> They knew overmuch. Therefore the gods took counsel as to how to proceed with man. They must not become as gods (note here the Christian influence). Let us now contract their sight so that they may only be able to see a portion of the earth and be content, said the gods. Then Hurakan breathed a cloud over their eyes, which became partially veiled. Then the four men slept, and four women were made, Caha-Paluma (Falling Water), Choimha (Beautiful Water), Tzununiha (House of the Water), and Cakixa (Water of Aras or Parrots), who became the wives of the men in their respective order as mentioned above.</p>
<p>These were the ancestors of the Kichés only. Then were created the ancestors of other peoples. They were ignorant of the methods of worship, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt;">25</a>]</span>and lifting their eyes to heaven prayed to the Creator, the Former, for peaceable lives and the return of the sun. But no sun came, and they grew uneasy. So they set out for Tulan-Zuiva, or the Seven Caves, and there gods were given unto them, each man, as head of a group of the race, a god. Balam-Quitzé received the god Tohil. Balam-Agab received the god Avilix, and Mahucutah the god Hacavitz. Iqi-Balam received a god, but as he had no family his god is not taken into account in the native mythology.</p>
<p>The Kichés now began to feel the want of fire, and the god Tohil, the creator of fire, supplied them with this element. But soon afterwards a mighty rain extinguished all the fires in the land. Tohil, however, always renewed the supply. And fire in those days was the chief necessity, for as yet there was no sun.</p>
<p>Tulan was a place of misfortune to man, for not only did he suffer from cold and famine, but here his speech was so confounded that the first four men were no longer able to comprehend each other. They determined to leave Tulan, and under the leadership of the god Tohil set out to search for a new abode. On they wandered through innumerable hardships. Many mountains had they to climb, and a long passage to make through the sea which was miraculously divided for their journey from shore to shore. At length they came to a mountain <span style="font-size: 12pt;">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt;">26</a>]</span>which they called Hacavitz, after one of their gods, and here they rested, for here they had been instructed that they should see the sun. And the sun appeared. Animals and men were transported with delight. All the celestial bodies were now established. But the sun was not as it is to-day. He was not strong, but as reflected in a mirror.</p>
<p>As he arose the three tribal gods were turned into stone, as were the gods—probably totems—connected with the wild animals. Then arose the first Kiché city.</p>
<p>As time progressed the first men grew old, and, impelled by visions, they began to offer human sacrifices. For this purpose they raided the villages of the neighbouring peoples, who retaliated. But by the miraculous aid of a horde of wasps and hornets the Kichés utterly routed their enemies. And the aliens became tributory to them.</p>
<p>Now it came nigh the death-time of the first men, and they called their descendants together to hearken unto their last counsels. In the anguish of their hearts they sang the Kamucu, the song “We see,” that they had sung when it first became light. Then they took leave of their wives and sons, one by one. And suddenly they were not. But in their place was a huge bundle, which was never unfolded. And it was called the “Majesty Enveloped.” And so died the first men of the Kichés. <span style="font-size: 12pt;">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt;">27</a>]</span></p>
