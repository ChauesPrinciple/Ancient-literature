                <p>Gilgamesh</p>
                <p><em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is one of the oldest pieces of literature in history. It is also
                    considered the first epic and one of the greatest works of ancient Mesopotamia. The popularity of
                    the hero Gilgamesh, as well as his struggle with meaning in the face of human mortality, account for
                    the prolific spread of Gilgamesh throughout the Near East in ancient times, around the second
                    millennium B.C.E. Yet, as with all things, Gilgamesh was forgotten. It was not rediscovered until
                    the 19th century by archeologists.</p>
                <p>Gilgamesh’s kingdom, the city-state of Uruk in South Mesopotamia, is in modern-day Iraq. The
                    monumental walls of the city were ten kilometers long and may have had as many as nine hundred
                    towers. Parts of Uruk, and those famous walls, can still be seen to this day. Gilgamesh, the
                    historical king, ruled around 2700 B.C.E., but the earliest story of Gilgamesh does not appear until
                    2100 B.C.E. The story is written in cuneiform script: wedge-shaped characters engraved into clay or
                    stone.</p>
                <p>The final revision of the epic is attributed to a Babylonian priest named Sin-leqi-unninni, who lived
                    around 1200 B.C.E. His version contains eleven chapters divided over eleven clay tablets. New
                    fragments of the epic are still being discovered in archaeological excavations, and some pieces are
                    still fragmented or missing. </p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Gilgamesh is the quintessential epic hero. His struggle to face the mortality of his friend Enkidu’s
                    and his own humanity, and to derive meaning from that struggle is universal. In the epic, he appears
                    as “two-thirds divine” and “one-third human”: the offspring of the goddess Ninsun, who appears in
                    the shape of a wild cow, and a human father.</p>
                <p>While he may be a hero, at the beginning of the epic, Gilgamesh is the definition of a tyrant. He is
                    arrogant, brutal, and he oppresses his subjects. He even goes so far as to demand the rights of a
                    husband on the wedding night. When his people entreat the gods to intervene, they create Enkidu.
                    Enkidu is raised in the wilderness, and he is Gilgamesh’s equal in strength and prowess. After
                    Enkidu becomes a threat to the functioning of society in Uruk, Gilgamesh decides to tame Enkidu by
                    seducing him with a harlot, who uses her wiles to convince Enkidu to bath, cloth himself, and
                    partake of societal goods: bread and beer.</p>
                <p>Gilgamesh’s and Enkidu’s first meeting are contentious, and they fight to a draw. This fight,
                    however, cements their friendship. Wasting no time, they settle on their first epic feat: slay the
                    giant Humbaba, who guards Enlil’s great Cedar Forest, in present-day Lebanon. They destroy Humbaba
                    and float the great Cedar Forest down the Euphrates River. This success is not without punishment,
                    however; the dying giant lays a curse on the duo, and the god Enlil is enraged.</p>
                <p>The second remarkable feat of the duo does not turn out so well. Gilgamesh’s victory over the great
                    Humbaba attracts the attention of the goddess Ishtar, who wishes to take Gilgamesh as her own.
                    Gilgamesh still struggles with hubris and chides Ishtar harshly, rather than politely resisting her
                    advances. She calls down the Bull of Heaven to destroy both Gilgamesh and Enkidu. They can conquer
                    the Bull of Heaven but not without a price. The gods believe the duo have overstepped and that an
                    example must be set. There is a gap in the text here, but, ultimately, the gods settle on afflicting
                    Enkidu with death because Gilgamesh is king. </p>
                <p>Gilgamesh mourns his friend. When a worm crawls out of Enkidu’s nose, however, Gilgamesh is forced to
                    come face to face with the truth: everything dies, including him. He is terrified by the prospect of
                    dying. Gilgamesh forsakes his kingdom and sets out on a journey to find Utanapishtim, the only human
                    known to defeat death and the survivor of the Great Flood. This journey is long, challenging, and
                    full of trials. Ultimately Gilgamesh must cross the waters of death to arrive on Utanapishtim’s
                    doorstep. Utanapishtim and his wife recount their experience of surviving the Great Flood, which is
                    very similar to Noah and the Great Flood in <em>Genesis</em>. They give Gilgamesh one last hope: a
                    magic plant that can restore his youth. The plant is stolen by a serpent, however, and Gilgamesh is
                    forced to return empty-handed and still mortal. By the end, however, he is a profoundly changed man.
