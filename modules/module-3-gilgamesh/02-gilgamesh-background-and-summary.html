<h1>Gilgamesh</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Gilgamesh</p>
<p><em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is one of the oldest pieces of literature in history. It is also considered the first epic and one of the greatest works of ancient Mesopotamia. The popularity of the hero Gilgamesh, as well as his struggle with meaning in the face of human mortality, account for the prolific spread of Gilgamesh throughout the Near East in ancient times, around the second millennium B.C.E. Yet, as with all things, Gilgamesh was forgotten. It was not rediscovered until the 19th century by archeologists.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh’s kingdom, the city-state of Uruk in South Mesopotamia, is in modern-day Iraq. The monumental walls of the city were ten kilometers long and may have had as many as nine hundred towers. Parts of Uruk, and those famous walls, can still be seen to this day. Gilgamesh, the historical king, ruled around 2700 B.C.E., but the earliest story of Gilgamesh does not appear until 2100 B.C.E. The story is written in cuneiform script: wedge-shaped characters engraved into clay or stone.</p>
<p>The final revision of the epic is attributed to a Babylonian priest named Sin-leqi-unninni, who lived around 1200 B.C.E. His version contains eleven chapters divided over eleven clay tablets. New fragments of the epic are still being discovered in archaeological excavations, and some pieces are still fragmented or missing.  </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Gilgamesh is the quintessential epic hero. His struggle to face the mortality of his friend Enkidu’s and his own humanity, and to derive meaning from that struggle is universal. In the epic, he appears as “two-thirds divine” and “one-third human”: the offspring of the goddess Ninsun, who appears in the shape of a wild cow, and a human father.</p>
<p>While he may be a hero, at the beginning of the epic, Gilgamesh is the definition of a tyrant. He is arrogant, brutal, and he oppresses his subjects. He even goes so far as to demand the rights of a husband on the wedding night. When his people entreat the gods to intervene, they create Enkidu. Enkidu is raised in the wilderness, and he is Gilgamesh’s equal in strength and prowess. After Enkidu becomes a threat to the functioning of society in Uruk, Gilgamesh decides to tame Enkidu by seducing him with a harlot, who uses her wiles to convince Enkidu to bath, cloth himself, and partake of societal goods: bread and beer.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh’s and Enkidu’s first meeting are contentious, and they fight to a draw. This fight, however, cements their friendship. Wasting no time, they settle on their first epic feat: slay the giant Humbaba, who guards Enlil’s great Cedar Forest, in present-day Lebanon. They destroy Humbaba and float the great Cedar Forest down the Euphrates River. This success is not without punishment, however; the dying giant lays a curse on the duo, and the god Enlil is enraged.</p>
<p>The second remarkable feat of the duo does not turn out so well. Gilgamesh’s victory over the great Humbaba attracts the attention of the goddess Ishtar, who wishes to take Gilgamesh as her own. Gilgamesh still struggles with hubris and chides Ishtar harshly, rather than politely resisting her advances. She calls down the Bull of Heaven to destroy both Gilgamesh and Enkidu. They can conquer the Bull of Heaven but not without a price. The gods believe the duo have overstepped and that an example must be set. There is a gap in the text here, but, ultimately, the gods settle on afflicting Enkidu with death because Gilgamesh is king. </p>
<p>Gilgamesh mourns his friend. When a worm crawls out of Enkidu’s nose, however, Gilgamesh is forced to come face to face with the truth: everything dies, including him. He is terrified by the prospect of dying. Gilgamesh forsakes his kingdom and sets out on a journey to find Utanapishtim, the only human known to defeat death and the survivor of the Great Flood. This journey is long, challenging, and full of trials. Ultimately Gilgamesh must cross the waters of death to arrive on Utanapishtim’s doorstep. Utanapishtim and his wife recount their experience of surviving the Great Flood, which is very similar to Noah and the Great Flood in <em>Genesis</em>. They give Gilgamesh one last hope: a magic plant that can restore his youth. The plant is stolen by a serpent, however, and Gilgamesh is forced to return empty-handed and still mortal. By the end, however, he is a profoundly changed man.</p>

<h2>Analysis:</h2>
<p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
<p>Tablet of Gilgamesh</p>
<p>At its core, Gilgamesh is the first and prototypical "<strong>Heroes Journey</strong>," so it should come as no surprise that this text deals explicitly with the idea of <strong>“</strong><strong>heroic systems</strong>.<strong>”</strong> The Ninevite version of the epic begins with a prologue in praise of Gilgamesh, who is two-thirds divine and one-third human, the great builder, warrior, and knower of all things on land and sea. </p>
<p>This is similar to what Christian theologian Blaze Pascal says about humanity, “Man is neither angel nor beast, and unhappily whoever wants to act the angel acts the beast.” Gilgamesh's conflict is a central conflict of our species, and when we meet him, he is very much the beast.</p>
<p>In books like <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</em> and <em>The Power of Myth</em>, Campbell reports on the deep structure of narrative that he found while comparing the myths and legends of many cultures using <strong>inductive reasoning</strong>. “<strong>The Hero’s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Journey</strong>” was his all-embracing metaphor for the deep inner journey of transformation that heroes in every time and place seem to share: a path that leads them through great movements of departure, initiation, and returns. All these stages are divided into three larger sections. The first part, the <strong>Departure</strong>, includes the following stages:</p>
<p>The Status Quo</p>
<p>The Call to Adventure</p>
<p>Assistance</p>
<p>Departure</p>
<p>The second part, the <strong>Initiation</strong>, includes the following stages:</p>
<p>Trials</p>
<p>Approach to the Innermost Cave</p>
<p>Crisis</p>
<p>Treasure</p>
<p>Result</p>
<p>The third part, the <strong>Return</strong>, includes the following stages:</p>
<p>Return</p>
<p>Resurrection</p>
<p>When we first meet Gilgamesh, he is a bit of a bastard. Power, it seems, has corrupted him, and his people cry out for help. The gods’ answer and Enkidu are born. Enkidu is Gilgamesh's equal, and in a sense, he "tames" Gilgamesh in the same way Shamhat tames Enkidu's impulses. There is one key difference in those impulses, however: Enkidu's are fueled with purpose and compassion, whereas Gilgamesh's are selfish and cruel. Why? </p>
