                <h3>Beowulf in Old English</h3>

                <p>In this text, Beowulf, as a warrior and a king, fulfills the <strong>Anglo-Saxon</strong> idea of
                    heroism in the epic poem through strength, humility, and essential goodness. Some critics, on the
                    other hand, argue that Beowulf resembles an <strong>Aristotelian tragic protagonist</strong>, one
                    whose <strong>hubris</strong>, or god-defying pride, leads him to nemesis—an ultimately destructive
                    force—and catharsis—the emotional release a champion achieves at his tragic end.</p>

                <p>I disagree.</p>

                <p>This popular reading of <em>Beowulf</em> ignores the function and purpose of the epic poem as being
                    both allegorical and instructive to its audience, the Anglo-Saxons, or whom we now call British. We
                    can, however, garner a better understanding of <em>Beowulf</em> by applying the logic of Dr. Shay’s
                    work on <strong>superstructures</strong> (for example, government, overarching systems) and how they
                    influence the warrior (please recall the role the “commander,” or REMF, plays in the betrayal of
                    one’s moral code by deeming it “moral”) by dissecting something that may surprise you: the complex
                    interplay of <strong>gender</strong> within <em>Beowulf</em>.</p>

                <p>To understand the historical and thematic underpinnings of the text, it is also important to
                    acknowledge the obvious connection between <strong>Beowulf</strong> and <strong>Grendel</strong> (in
                    an interesting comparison, this is the inverse relationship of Enkidu and Gilgamesh). From the
                    outset, it is obvious that the poet meant to create an immediate comparison between Beowulf and his
                    foes, for the author describes the hero and the antagonist in parallel terms. Upon close
                    examination, Grendel is the focus of the literary poem and likely the underlying oral tradition, for
                    neither the mother nor the dragon was "around long enough to be named."</p>

                <p>It is no accident that the Anglo-Saxon term "aglǣca" is used for both Beowulf and Grendel. The two
                    are both "fierce fighters," equal combatants, and the true test of one another's might.</p>

                <p>Considering the structure of the poem, we see that Grendel, who is so central to the poem and
                    dominates so many of its lines, should be the creature who is given a name and a vivid identity.</p>

                <p>Grendel may be related to Old English <em>gryndal</em> "fierce, angry" and Old Norse
                    <em>grindill</em> "storm, wind"; it may also be derived from the Old English verb <em>grindan</em>
                    "to grind, destroy.”
                </p>

                <p>The text states "Grendel nemdon foldbúende," which translates roughly to "the earth-dwelling people
                    named him Grendel." So, he was specifically named Grendel by the Danes.</p>

                <p>The text often refers to Grendel with additional monstrous qualifiers (e.g., "wæs se grimma gaést
                    Grendel háten" or "this ghastly demon was named Grendel").</p>

                <p>So, it is not as if Grendel was a generic "grendel," nor is it that there were more of his kind out
                    there. Grendel was a monster with the name "Grendel." This marks him as distinctly different from
                    both his mother and the dragon.</p>

                <h4>The Matter of Numbers</h4>
                <p>There is also the matter of numbers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grendel can “genam thritig thegna” (“he can seize thirty men at once”).</li>
                    <li>According to Hrothgar, Beowulf has “thritiges manna magencruft on his mundgripe” (“the strength
                        of thirty in his hand”).</li>
                    <li>A point further illustrated later on when Beowulf swims off with thirty suits of armor from
                        Hygelac’s battle against the Franks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Their Murderous Progenitors</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Beowulf’s father, Ecgtheow, was on the run for killing Heatholaf of the Wulfings (and not paying
                        wergild).</li>
                    <li>Grendel descends from Cain, who is likewise on the run for his crime of killing another.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Furthermore, in preparation for their battle, Beowulf notes that since Grendel “for his wonhydum
                    waepna ne recceth” –or “does not use a weapon, armor, or shield,” nor will he, <strong>thereby
                        directly casting himself as Grendel’s equal</strong>. Beowulf and Grendel also come from
                    essentially single-parent families and have mothers who are never clearly named. For these reasons,
                    that the primary purpose of this text is tied up with the difference between Beowulf and Grendel.
                </p>

                <p>Another important aspect for understanding <em>Beowulf</em> is the role of women. The role of a woman
                    in <em>Beowulf</em>, as in Anglo-Saxon society, primarily depends on <strong>peacemaking</strong>,
                    either <em>biologically</em>, through her marital ties with foreign kings as a <strong>peace
                        pledge</strong> or mother of sons, or <em>socially</em> and psychologically, through her role in
                    <strong>cup-passing</strong> and <strong>peace-weaving</strong> as the Queen within a hall. So, yes,
                    Wealhtheow is a walking peace treaty. Whom Wealhtheow gives the cup to, and when, at dinner is part
                    of that “peace.”
                </p>

                <p>This societal function is unfamiliar to many modern readers, perhaps, so it requires us to make
                    another comparison, between Wealhtheow and Grendel’s Mother:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wealhtheow:</strong> described as “fithu-sibb folca” or “Peace pledge between nations”–
                        Which nations? All “good” women in <em>Beowulf</em> act as “peace weavers.” She is the picture
                        of the “Perfect Queen.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Grendel’s Mother:</strong> Described as “ides agaewif,” ides = lady; algaeca = a
                        monster, fighter, or hero. Both the Mother and Beowulf are described as “gaest” or guests. Is
                        she a monster? A warrior? Is she a monster because she does not weave peace? Is this ideal pagan
                        or Christian?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Grendel’s mother’s “action section” is also situated between the Finnsburg Episode and the scene
                    wherein Wealhtheow seeks protection for her sons. It is worth exploring the dramatic irony of this
                    historical digression because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modthryth is a foil for Hygd.</li>
                    <li>Moreover, Modthryth is only “monstrous” <strong>as long as she is single</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By pitting the women in the digression as foils to one another and demonstrating Modthryth’s
                    transformation into an acceptable woman through marriage, the text’s structure pits the two main
                    women of our story against each other. This begs the question, is Grendel’s mother, then, a foil for
                    Wealhtheow? Please consider that Grendel’s mother may be acting as a mirror for strong Norse women
                    like Brunhild of the Nibelungenlied, which would not have been in keeping with the Christian
                    society, which was of a “guilt” culture in this region of the Saxony (the British Isles).</p>

                <p>Critics have discussed Grendel's Mother as a peculiar brand of monster and have generally been uneasy
                    with her femininity.</p>

                <p>Broadly speaking, the association between the categories of monster and woman developed into
                    criticism of Grendel's Mother as a hyper-masculine female, who is an extension of Grendel, and
                    criticism of her as a representative of the threatening archaic feminine.</p>

                <p>In this way, Grendel’s mother has a lot in common with Euripides’ Medea, coming later, and is more
                    widely a representation of Christian ideals moving throughout Europe and designating the role of
                    women as submissive, which was not the case in the Norse tradition.</p>

                <p>As a monster, she is a threat in her very similarity to the hero; if she were truly "other," she
                    would be beyond description. As Hala and Overing point out, the text makes her secondary to her son
                    when she must be logically prior and excludes her from the <strong>symbolic</strong> by not giving
                    her a name. Beowulf opposes Grendel's Mother, and she is Overing's "nameless woman" (Overing 73);
                    her femininity is dubious at times since she is only "idese onlicnes" or "in the likeness of a
                    woman.”</p>

                <p>The danger, however, is never done away with. It is the oppositional relationship between Beowulf, as
                    the protector of “society,” and Grendel’s mother, or the “<strong>other</strong>,” that is unstable
                    and dangerous, rather than the sex of either. That is, of course, because Grendel's Mother also
                    embodies the threat of "the monstrous woman," the maternal excess, the avenger, and the imitation
                    man. However, she is more than the dark Valkyrie, or female other, so frequently found (or
                    suspected) in medieval texts.</p>

                <p>To explore this further, let us consider the Finnsburg episode and how it acts as a foil for Beowulf
                    and the Danes. After Grendel’s death, Hrothgar even speaks of adopting Beowulf. This is both strange
                    and important. First, it is strange because Beowulf is not a Dane! Hrothgar is acting well outside
                    of Norse's custom to offer a bond of peace and honor without marriage. Furthermore, <strong>despite
                        Beowulf being described as “lof-geornst” – keenest to win fame</strong>, having stated that
                    “glory before death…will be his best and only bulwark,” and that “it is always better to avenge dear
                    ones than to indulge in mourning,” <strong>Beowulf acts as a “peace-weaver” between the Geats and
                        the Danes.</strong> This act is central to the text and notable because such vengeance often led
                    to blood-feuds, and Beowulf’s actions are in opposition.</p>

                <p>In the Hildebruth episode, the lay identifies Hnæf's last struggle as the aftermath of a battle
                    described as Fres-wæl (the "Frisian slaughter"), and it describes the mourning of Hildeburh after a
                    surprise attack by the Frisians on the Danes.</p>

                <p>Hildeburh, Hnæf's sister, was married to Finn, leader of the Frisians, <strong>to make peace between
                        the two tribes</strong>, though this attempt was unsuccessful and today is seen by many scholars
                    as to the source for tragedy in the piece.</p>

                <p>She mourned for the loss of her brother, Hnæf, whose funeral pyre was shared by her and Finn’s son.
                    After the battle, Finn and a character named Hengest make a loyalty pact. Hengest is a leader among
                    Hnæf's surviving warriors.</p>

                <p>By cleansing Heorot of the curse of Grendel, Beowulf achieves a trusted friendship and bond between
                    the Geats and the Danes–<strong>similar to what would have been expected if he had been exchanged
                        between the two nations as the modified bride</strong>. Indeed, Beowulf's deeds create a bond
                    with Hrothgar more durable than most of those in the poem established by intertribal marriage.</p>

                <p>Thus, when Beowulf crosses tribal lines to aid Hrothgar's Danes, even though his conduct includes
                    some sweaty brutality, Beowulf becomes distinctly feminized.</p>

                <p>This is especially important when considering that genders are not constructed onto pre-existing
                    sexed bodies; gender construction is not an act that can be deemed "finished" at a certain point
                    (Bodies 9).</p>

                <p>The performativity of gender depends on an understanding of gender construction as an ongoing process
                    (or performance) that is never ultimately complete.</p>

                <p>Within the poem, at least, male loyalty across tribal lines is very seldom cited as a virtuous trait.
                    When cross-tribal relationships between men are mentioned, they are usually cited within the context
                    of a female peace-weaving bond that has failed or is highly fragile. Women in Beowulf are, as
                    Enright puts it, the "mortar that cements the bricks" (Enright 202); they facilitate relationships
                    among men. Beowulf's meaning is clear enough in the poem:</p>

                <blockquote>"As a rule, the murderous spear will rest only for a short time under such circumstances [as
                    a marriage bond]" (Klaeber 203)</blockquote>

                <p>It does not matter how good the bride may be. Beowulf's skepticism is hardly surprising in a poem
                    that repeatedly emphasizes how human life is made up of transitory days. Accordingly, the other
                    intertribal marriage discussed in the poem—that of Hildeburh in the Finnsburg episode—ends in
                    slaughter and vendetta.</p>

                <p>In Chance's words, "The efforts of the peacemaker, while valuable in worldly and social terms,
                    ultimately must fail because of the nature of this world" (Chance 106-7).</p>

                <p>Even Wealhtheow, with all her virtues, is unable to prevent the later conflagration at Heorot and the
                    death of her entire family. Ultimately, the poet draws such strong associations to highlight not how
                    threatening and dangerous the monsters are but rather how threatening and dangerous human beings
                    are, or at least can be.</p>

                <p>Despite their monstrous nature, the strength, appetite, and terror of the Grendelkin—and even the
                    flames and poison of the dragon—the monsters are ineffective and defeated. The greater, more
                    threatening force in the poem is people; Grendel can terrorize Heorot and Hrothgar, but he does not
                    destroy the hall nor kill Hrothgar and his kin. Heorot awaits destruction in “lathan liges,” the
                    “hateful flames” that will come in the feud between Hrothgar and his son-in-law Ingeld of the
                    Heatho-Bards. Then Hrothulf, Hrothgar’s trusted but treacherous kinsman, will seize the throne from
                    his cousin, Hrothgar’s son.</p>

                <p>Grendel’s mother, as monstrous as she is, is only acting out the approved social code of revenge, a
                    code reaffirmed in the lay of Hildeburh, told the very night Grendel’s mother attacks. Furthermore,
                    while Grendel’s mother is hunted down for seeking revenge for the death of her son, Hildeburh is
                    stripped of all right to such revenge for the death of her son, brother, and husband.</p>

                <p>Likewise, the dragon, for all his destructive abilities and justifiable anger at being robbed, does
                    not destroy the Geats; rather, the Franks, Frisians, and Swedes will obliterate the Geats, as the
                    messenger prophesizes at the end of the poem, which has come to pass, for we still have Franks,
                    Frisians, and Swedes, but no Geats.</p>

                <p>So, what does this have to do with Dr. Shay’s work?</p>

                <p>First, consider that this text is “English,” not “Norse,” and that it was transcribed by a Christian
                    monk. This text marks a transitional period from an honor-based Norse society to a Christian
                    Anglo-Saxon society, and it is the latter’s values that the text champions. <strong>This text, at
                        its heart, is about what it means to be a good king</strong>, which juxtaposes Agamemnon and
                    Beowulf as leaders. It is important to note that the difference between Scyld Scefing and Grendel is
                    not one of violence; they are both wreckers of mead halls. <strong>The difference is one of
                        generosity</strong>. Like Scyld, Beowulf is the ring giver, but he is also generous willing to
                    forfeit his life. This text is about the emergence of a king who serves his people, rather than a
                    king who expects the people to serve him. Beowulf achieves this by performing in a feminine way.</p>
