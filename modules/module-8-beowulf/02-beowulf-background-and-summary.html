                <p>Grendel's Arm on Display</p>
                <p><em>Beowulf </em>survives in a single medieval manuscript. The manuscript bears no date, and its age
                    must be calculated by analyzing the scribes’ handwriting. Some scholars have suggested that the
                    manuscript was made at the end of the 10th century, others in the early decades of the 11th, perhaps
                    as late as the reign of King Cnut, who ruled England from 1016 until 1035. The most likely time for
                    Beowulf to have been copied is the early 11th century, which makes the manuscript approximately
                    1,000 years old. Nobody knows for certain when the poem was first composed. </p>
                <p>For centuries, the Roman Empire had ruled much of the world, but by the start of the fifth century,
                    the Roman Empire had lost much of its power. Years of civil wars, political chaos, and successful
                    invasions by Germanic tribes, like the Visigoths and Vandals, forced the Romans to abandon lands
                    that were once under their control. The Roman retreat from the island of Britannia allowed several
                    nomadic tribes from Denmark and northern Germany, the Jutes, Saxons, and Engels, to claim this land
                    as their new home. When the first Anglo Saxon migrated to Britannia, they brought with them their
                    religious beliefs: Norse mythology, wherein they worshipped the gods: Thor, Odin, and Freya, among
                    many others. Evidence of these religious beliefs can still be found in the English names for the
                    first six days of the week, which are all named after gods of Norse mythology. </p>
                <p>The Nordic influence did not outlast the lingering Roman influence, however, and the religion of the
                    Roman Empire was Christianity. Due to the efforts of St. Patrick and other Christian missionaries,
                    the Celts who controlled nearby Ireland and parts of Scotland were predominantly Christian. As
                    Anglo-Saxon cultures spread across the island, marriage between the pagan immigrants and the
                    Christian Celts became common. This intermingling, combined with the missionary work of St.
                    Augustine of Canterbury, resulted in the rapid spread of Christianity among the Anglo-Saxon. </p>
                <p>Because many of the tales and histories of these cultures were spoken or sung and never written down
                    as part of an oral tradition, <em>Beowulf </em>could have been lost or forgotten, which is exactly
                    what happened to many ancient cultures that were once vibrant and flourishing. We know nothing of
                    their languages today, and the stories and histories we have of them are recorded by other cultures.
                    So, what made the Anglo-Saxon language different? Well, we have mentioned that the Anglo-Saxons
                    adopted the religion of the Romans. They were also influenced by other aspects of the Roman culture,
                    including the values that the Romans placed on writing. Like the Greeks before them, the Romans were
                    proud of their accomplishments and their culture; men who could record their histories and their
                    stories were held in high esteem. The works of Roman writers Ovid, Horace, Cicero, and Virgil are
                    widely read even today. If not for this Roman influence, the Anglo-Saxon language would likely not
                    have survived. </p>
                <p>There is not, of course, one single person who can be credited with the survival and preservation of
                    the English language, but there are individuals who stand out in history as playing a major role.
                    One of these is Alfred the Great. The first king of the Anglo-Saxon, Alfred, gained fame for
                    defeating a Viking invasion in 1878, and he remained king until he died in 1899. During his reign,
                    Alfred promoted education by requiring literacy of all men who held positions of authority by
                    establishing a court school where lessons were taught in English as well as by writing and
                    translating works into English himself, partly due to his influence and the value that he placed on
                    education and writing in the common language.</p>
                <p>We have over 400 surviving manuscripts written in Anglo-Saxon or Old English, as we call it. One of
                    these manuscripts, called the Noel Codex, contains the earliest example of English poetry. That poem
                    is <em>Beowulf</em>. </p>
                <p><em>Beowulf</em> is the oldest epic poem written in English. It was probably written down by monks
                    sometime between the 8th and 11th century, and Beowulf is also the first epic hero in English
                    literature, even though the character Beowulf is not English himself. He also happens to be the
                    first dragon slayer in English literature. The poem employs many of the literary devices that
                    writers still use today, and it contains some of the earliest English language examples of metaphor,
                    irony, foreshadowing, understatement, <strong>alliteration,</strong> and more. Furthermore, even
                    though many Christian elements have been added to the original Anglo-Saxon tale, <em>Beowulf
                    </em>gives us a glimpse into the Anglo-Saxon society in the Middle Ages, and it is written in the
                    common language of the Anglo-Saxon people, although it was written in England.</p>
                <p>The story is set in Denmark and Sweden since the early Anglos and Saxons passed stories down orally,
                    as we saw earlier. <em>Beowulf</em> is likely a great deal older than the period in which it was
                    written down. It gives us insight into the structure of society in everyday life, including the
                    concept of a <strong>comitatus</strong>, which refers to the bond of loyalty between Germanic rulers
                    and their warriors. The warriors, or <strong>thanes</strong> in the Anglo-Saxon story, must honor,
                    respect, serve, and <em>defend their ruler to the death</em>. He, in turn, <em>provides them with
                        protection </em><em>and</em><em> </em><em>a share of his wealth</em>. It is a relationship of
                    camaraderie and brotherhood with a strong emphasis on loyalty and kinship.</p>
                <p>When speaking of kindship, we must also speak of lineage. Lineage refers to a person's family line. A
                    hero fights and gains glory not only for himself but for those who went before him and for those who
                    will come after he brings honor to his family name. In the poem <em>Beowulf</em>, lineage is
                    important. Beowulf is descended from a brave warrior, while the monster Grendel is of a fatherless
                    race and is referred to as the descendant of Kane. This contrast underscores how important the idea
                    of lineage and family loyalty is to the Anglo-Saxons. Concerning lineage, it is also important to
                    understand the sections of <em>Beowulf</em>’s edited cultural background due to Christian influence.
                    Here is some historical information about <em>Beowulf</em> from a <em>contemporary</em>
                    historian<strong> </strong><strong>Saxo Grammaticus</strong>:</p>
                <p>Thora, who has not stopped grieving over her lost maidenhead, invents a wicked deception to take
                    hideous revenge… she deliberately sends her daughter… down to the shore, instructing her to defile
                    her father in fornication.</p>
                <p>Helgi (or Halga): Inadvertently marries his daughter Yrse, and the hero Hrolf (Hrothulf) is their
                    offspring. When Yrse learns she has married her father, she runs away and marries the Swedish king
                    Adils (Eagdils). Hrolf attacks Eagdil’s kingdom to revenge his father’s, Halga’s, death at the hand
                    of Eagdil.</p>
                <p>Yrse and Onela: Onela goes on to kill Beowulf’s lord, Heardred, putting Beowulf on the throne.
                    Beowulf has him killed in revenge.</p>
                <p>Sigemund and Fitela Digression: Signy seduces her brother (Sigemund) without her brother’s knowledge
                    to produce a warrior capable of revenging their father.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><em>Beowulf </em>begins with a description of the life of Scyld Scefing, the legendary ancestor of
                    the Scyldings or the Danish royal family. The narrator then lists several descendants of Scyld
                    before getting to Hrothgar, who rules from the hall of Heorot. Beowulf and his thegns arrive at
                    Heorot to assist Hrothgar against the monster Grendel. Grendel is described as a descendant of the
                    biblical Cain (evidence of the Christian layering to the text by the scribe) and is an outsider
                    among men. It is clear, through instances like this, that the poet was Christian writing for a
                    Christian audience. Grendel, for example, is explained by the poet-narrator as a diabolical
                    descendant of Cain, the first murderer, from whose off-spring, according to the Old Testament and
                    Judeo-Christian Apocrypha, arose the various races of giants.</p>
                <p>The narrator explains that the sounds of celebration and joy coming from Heorot agonize Grendel.
                    Grendel begins attacking Heorot on a nightly basis, killing and devouring Hrothgar's warriors.
                    Beowulf hears about Hrothgar’s plight while at home in Geatland. He receives the permission of the
                    Geatish king to travel with his warriors to Denmark and fight Grendel. Beowulf and his followers are
                    welcomed by Hrothgar and his wife Wealhtheow. Unferth, one of Hrothgar's warriors, is skeptical
                    about Beowulf's abilities. As the two fling insults at each other, Beowulf recounts the reason he
                    lost a swimming competition: he had to battle some sea monsters is all. </p>
                <p>Before his battle with Grendel, Beowulf announces he will fight Grendel alone and unarmed, so he
                    pretends to sleep while waiting for Grendel's arrival. When Grendel appears, Beowulf attacks him,
                    and they begin to grapple with each other. When his warriors try to attempt to help, the swords are
                    unable to pierce Grendel's skin. Beowulf ultimately rips Grendel's right arm off, and the monster
                    flees and dies alone. The arm is hung up as a trophy, and Beowulf's victory is celebrated.</p>
                <p>The following night, Grendel's mother arrives. Infuriated by the death of her son, she attacks
                    Heorot. Grendel's mother drags Aeschere, Hrothgar's most trusted warrior, out of the hall and kills
                    him. Beowulf and the other warriors track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. The warrior
                    Unferth presents Beowulf with his sword, Hrunting, and Beowulf prepares with Hrothgar should he be
                    killed in the coming fight. Beowulf then plunges into the water. After sinking for days, he
                    discovers a cave where Grendel and his mother have been living. </p>
                <p>In the cave, Beowulf finds Grendel's body. He engages Grendel's mother in combat, but Unferth's sword
                    cannot pierce her skin. Beowulf eventually finds another magic sword forged by a giant in Grendel’s
                    mothers’ horde, and uses it to decapitate Grendel’s mother. He then takes their heads Grendel and
                    his mother back to Hrothgar. In reward, Hrothgar showers Beowulf in gifts, including his ancestral
                    sword, Naegling. <strong>What follows is a lengthy speech by Hrothgar, urging Beowulf to remain
                        humble and to be generous to his thegns</strong>. In essence, Hrothgar <em>is espousing the
                        proper behavior of a successful king and warlord</em>. This would have reflected the values of
                    the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy more so than their counterparts in the other early Germanic kingdoms.
                </p>
                <p>Beowulf returns home to the Geats, where his hard-won glory is celebrated and rewarded by his uncle
                    King Hygelac. Fifty years pass, and Beowulf, now an older man, is the king of the Geats when his
                    people are menaced by a fire-breathing dragon. An elderly Beowulf is forced to confront a rampaging
                    dragon. The narrator explains that a slave stole a cup from the dragon's hoard. This prompts the
                    furious beast to leave its lair and attack the countryside. <em>The image of the dragon hoarding its
                        treasure can be contrasted with generous kings and lords who properly reward their warriors and
                        thegns for</em><em> their</em><em> faithful military service</em>. Beowulf leads an expedition
                    to the dragon’s barrow, where he intends to fight the creature in single combat (as in the days of
                    his youth and glory). A key difference in this battle, which we will cover further in the analysis,
                    is that for the first time, <em>his warrior</em><em>s</em> (except Wiglaf)<em> run away because they
                        do not believe Beowulf can win</em>. The old king is overmatched but seized by the neck in the
                    dragon's mighty jaws; Beowulf achieves victory with the help of his young kinsman Wiglaf and at the
                    cost of his own life. </p>
                <p>Such a bare summary makes the plot and structure of the poem sound straightforward, but one of the
                    distinctive characteristics of Beowulf is the way the poet skillfully moves back and forth along the
                    linear narrative timeline, <strong>interweaving the main events of the poem with a plethora of inset
                        and secondary </strong><strong>historical </strong><strong>narratives</strong>. Foreground and
                    background merge in this consummate example of <strong>'interlace' structure</strong> so that the
                    exploits of Beowulf himself are inextricably immersed within a richer background of the heroic
                    legend.</p>
                <p>This is the breakdown of the plot structure into its “principal parts.”</p>

                <p>With the historical digressions removed, this story is not only straightforward, but it probably is
                    also familiar: it directly inspired a famous author, Tolkien. The language that Beowulf employs
                    provides an astonishing level of creative and poetic verbal inventiveness—particularly evident in
                    the use of uniquely-occurring descriptive compound words:<strong> A kenning, </strong>which is a
                    figure of speech in which two words are combined to form a poetic expression that refers to a person
                    or a thing. For example, "whale-road" is a kenning for the sea.<strong> Kennings are most often
                        found in Old Norse and Old English poetry</strong>—and by a layer of verbal formulas and “type
                    scenes,” which recur throughout both the poem and the surviving corpus of Old English poetry.</p>
                <p>Tolkien was not just a fan, he was also a published “critic” of <em>Beowulf</em>. He even wrote his
                    translation of the text. The similarities between Beowulf and Tolkien’s work do not stop there.
                    However, it is more explicit than we might think.</p>

                <p>The term "ring" here, however, is not the same kind of ring we think of. Our modern English word
                    'ring' comes from an Old English word, hring. A "beag" (is modern English for 'ring') is a ring worn
                    around the arm, rather than the finger, and served somewhat as a monetary unit in early Germanic
                    societies.</p>

                <h2>Analysis</h2>
                <p><!-- [IMAGE INTENDED HERE] --></p>
                <p>Beowulf in Old English</p>
                <p>In this text, Beowulf, as a warrior and a king, fulfills the <strong>Anglo-Saxon</strong> idea of
                    heroism in the epic poem through strength, humility, and essential goodness.Some critics, on the
                    other hand, argue that Beowulf resembles an <strong>Aristotelian tragic protagonist</strong>, one
                    whose <strong>hubris</strong>, or god-defying pride, leads him to nemesis—an ultimately destructive
                    force—and catharsis—the emotional release a champion achieves at his tragic end.</p>
                <p>I disagree.</p>
                <p>This popular reading of <em>Beowulf</em> ignores the function and purpose of the epic poem as being
                    both allegorical and instructive to its audience, the Anglo-Saxons, or whom we now call British. We
                    can, however, garner a better understanding of <em>Beowulf</em> by applying the logic of Dr. Shay’s
                    work on <strong>superstructures</strong> (for example, government, overarching systems) and how they
                    influence the warrior (please recall the role the “commander,” or REMF, plays in the betrayal of
                    one’s moral code by deeming it “moral”) by dissecting something that may surprise you: the complex
                    interplay of <strong>gender</strong> within <em>Beowulf</em>. </p>
                <p>To understand the historical and thematic underpinnings of the text, it is also important to
                    acknowledge the obvious connection between <strong>Beowulf</strong> and <strong>Grendel</strong> (in
                    an interesting comparison, this is the inverse relationship of Enkidu and Gilgamesh). From the
                    outset, it is obvious that the poet meant to create an immediate comparison between Beowulf and his
                    foes, for the author describes the hero and the antagonist in parallel terms. Upon close
                    examination, Grendel is the focus of the literary poem and likely the underlying oral tradition, for
                    neither the mother nor the dragon was "around long enough to be named."</p>
                <p>It is no accident that the Anglo-Saxon term "aglǣca" is used for both Beowulf and Grendel. The two
                    are both "fierce fighters," equal combatants, and the true test of one another's might. </p>
                <p>Considering the structure of the poem, we see that Grendel, who is so central to the poem and
                    dominates so many of its lines, should be the creature who is given a name and a vivid identity.</p>
                <p>Grendel may be related to Old English gryndal "fierce, angry" and Old Norse grindill "storm, wind";
                    it may also be derived from the Old English verb grindan "to grind, destroy.”</p>
                <p>The text states "Grendel nemdon foldbúende," which translates roughly to "the earth-dwelling people
                    named him Grendel." So, he was specifically named Grendel by the Danes.</p>
                <p>The text often refers to Grendel with additional monstrous qualifiers (e.g., "wæs se grimma gaést
                    Grendel háten" or "this ghastly demon was named Grendel"). </p>
                <p>So, it is not as if Grendel was a generic "grendel," nor is it that there were more of his kind out
                    there. Grendel was a monster with the name "Grendel." This marks him as distinctly different from
                    both his mother and the dragon.</p>
                <p>There is also the matter of numbers:</p>
                <p>Grendel can “genam thritig thegna” (“he can seize thirty men at once”). </p>
                <p>According to Hrothgar, Beowulf has “thritiges manna magencruft on his mundgripe” (“the strength of
                    thirty in his hand”). </p>
                <p>A point further illustrated later on when Beowulf swims off with thirty suits of armor from Hygelac’s
                    battle against the Franks.</p>
                <p>And their murderous progenitors: </p>
                <p>Beowulf’s father, Ecgtheow, was on the run for killing Heatholaf of the Wulfings (and not paying
                    wergild). </p>
                <p>Grendel descends from Cain, who is likewise on the run for his crime of killing another.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, in preparation for their battle, Beowulf notes that since Grendel “for his wonhydum
                    waepna ne recceth” –or “does not use a weapon, armor, or shield,” nor will he, <strong>thereby
                        directly casting himself as Grendel’s equal</strong>. Beowulf and Grendel also come from
                    essentially single-parent families and have mothers who are never clearly named. For these reasons,
                    that the primary purpose of this text is tied up with the difference between Beowulf and Grendel.
                </p>
                <p>Another important aspect for understanding <em>Beowulf</em> is the role of women. The role of a woman
                    in <em>Beowulf</em>, as in Anglo-Saxon society, primarily depends on <strong>peacemaking</strong>,
                    either <em>biologically</em>, through her marital ties with foreign kings as a <strong>peace
                        pledge</strong> or mother of sons, or <em>socially</em> and psychologically, through her role in
                    <strong>cup-passing</strong> and <strong>peace-weaving</strong> as the Queen within a hall. So, yes,
                    Wealhtheow is a walking peace treaty. Whom Wealhtheow gives the cup to, and when, at dinner is part
                    of that “peace.”</p>
                <p>This societal function is unfamiliar to many modern readers, perhaps, so it requires us to make
                    another comparison, between Wealhtheow and Grendel’s Mother: </p>
                <p>Wealhtheow: described as “fithu-sibb folca” or “Peace pledge between nations”– Which nations? All
                    “good” women in <em>Beowulf</em> act as “peace weavers.” She is the picture of the “Perfect Queen.”
                </p>
                <p>Grendel’s Mother: Described as “ides agaewif,” ides = lady; algaeca = a monster, fighter, or hero.
                    Both the Mother and Beowulf are described as “gaest” or guests. Is she a monster? A warrior? Is she
                    a monster because she does not weave peace? Is this ideal pagan or Christian?</p>
                <p>Grendel’s mother’s “action section” is also situated between the Finnsburg Episode and the scene
                    wherein Wealhtheow seeks protection for her sons. It is worth exploring the dramatic irony of this
                    historical digression because:</p>
                <p>Modthryth is a foil for Hygd.</p>
                <p>Moreover, Modthryth is only “monstrous” <strong>as long as</strong><strong> she is single</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>By pitting the women in the digression as foils to one another and demonstrating Modthryth’s
                    transformation into an acceptable woman through marriage, the text’s structure pits the two main
                    women of our story against each other. This begs the question, is Grendel’s mother, then, a foil for
                    Wealhtheow? Please consider that Grendel’s mother may be acting as a mirror for strong Norse women
                    like Brunhild of the Nibelungenlied, which would not have been in keeping with the Christian
                    society, which was of a “guilt” culture in this region of the Saxony (the British Isles). </p>
                <p>Critics have discussed Grendel's Mother as a peculiar brand of monster and have generally been uneasy
                    with her femininity.</p>
                <p>Broadly speaking, the association between the categories of monster and woman developed into
                    criticism of Grendel's Mother as a hyper-masculine female, who is an extension of Grendel, and
                    criticism of her as a representative of the threatening archaic feminine. </p>
                <p>In this way, Grendel’s mother has a lot in common with Euripides’ Medea, coming later, and is more
                    widely a representation of Christian ideals moving throughout Europe and designating the role of
                    women as submissive, which was not the case in the Norse tradition.</p>
                <p>As a monster, she is a threat in her very similarity to the hero; if she were truly "other," she
                    would be beyond description. As Hala and Overing point out, the text makes her secondary to her son
                    when she must be logically prior and excludes her from the <strong>symbolic</strong> by not giving
                    her a name. Beowulf opposes Grendel's Mother, and she is Overing's "nameless woman" (Overing 73);
                    her femininity is dubious at times since she is only "idese onlicnes" or "in the likeness of a
                    woman.” </p>
                <p>The danger, however, is never done away with. It is the oppositional relationship between Beowulf, as
                    the protector of “society,” and Grendel’s mother, or the “<strong>other</strong>,” that is unstable
                    and dangerous, rather than the sex of either. That is, of course, because Grendel's Mother also
                    embodies the threat of "the monstrous woman," the maternal excess, the avenger, and the imitation
                    man. However, she is more than the dark Valkyrie, or female other, so frequently found (or
                    suspected) in medieval texts.</p>
                <p>To explore this further, let us consider the Finnsburg episode and how it acts as a foil for Beowulf
                    and the Danes. After Grendel’s death, Hrothgar even speaks of adopting Beowulf. This is both strange
                    and important. First, it is strange because Beowulf is not a Dane! Hrothgar is acting well outside
                    of Norse's custom to offer a bond of peace and honor without marriage. Furthermore,
                    <strong>d</strong><strong>espite Beowulf being described as
                        “</strong><strong>lof-geornst</strong><strong>” – keenest to win </strong><strong>fame</strong>,
                    having stated that “glory before death…will be his best and only bulwark,” and that “it is always
                    better to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning,” <strong>Beowulf acts as a “peace-weaver”
                        between the Geats and the Danes.</strong> This act is central to the text and notable because
                    such vengeance often led to blood-feuds, and Beowulf’s actions are in opposition.</p>
                <p>In the Hildebruth episode, the lay identifies Hnæf's last struggle as the aftermath of a battle
                    described as Fres-wæl (the "Frisian slaughter"), and it describes the mourning of Hildeburh after a
                    surprise attack by the Frisians on the Danes. </p>
                <p>Hildeburh, Hnæf's sister, was married to Finn, leader of the Frisians,<strong> to make peace between
                        the two tribes</strong>, though this attempt was unsuccessful and today is seen by many scholars
                    as to the source for tragedy in the piece. </p>
                <p>She mourned for the loss of her brother, Hnæf, whose funeral pyre was shared by her and Finn’s son.
                    After the battle, Finn and a character named Hengest make a loyalty pact. Hengest is a leader among
                    Hnæf's surviving warriors.</p>
                <p>By cleansing Heorot of the curse of Grendel, Beowulf achieves a trusted friendship and bond between
                    the Geats and the Danes–<strong>similar to</strong><strong> what would have been expected if he had
                        been exchanged between the two nations as the modified bride</strong>. Indeed, Beowulf's deeds
                    create a bond with Hrothgar more durable than most of those in the poem established by intertribal
                    marriage. </p>
                <p>Thus, when Beowulf crosses tribal lines to aid Hrothgar's Danes, even though his conduct includes
                    some sweaty brutality, Beowulf becomes distinctly feminized. </p>
                <p>This is especially important when considering that genders are not constructed onto pre-existing
                    sexed bodies; gender construction is not an act that can be deemed "finished" at a certain point
                    (Bodies 9). </p>
                <p>The performativity of gender depends on an understanding of gender construction as an ongoing process
                    (or performance) that is never ultimately complete.</p>
                <p>Within the poem, at least, male loyalty across tribal lines is very seldom cited as a virtuous trait.
                    When cross-tribal relationships between men are mentioned, they are usually cited within the context
                    of a female peace-weaving bond that has failed or is highly fragile. Women in Beowulf are, as
                    Enright puts it, the "mortar that cements the bricks" (Enright 202); they facilitate relationships
                    among men. Beowulf's meaning is clear enough in the poem: </p>
                <p>"As a rule, the murderous spear will rest only for a short time under such circumstances [as a
                    marriage bond]" (Klaeber 203)</p>
                <p>It does not matter how good the bride may be. Beowulf's skepticism is hardly surprising in a poem
                    that repeatedly emphasizes how human life is made up of transitory days. Accordingly, the other
                    intertribal marriage discussed in the poem—that of Hildeburh in the Finnsburg episode—ends in
                    slaughter and vendetta. </p>
                <p>In Chance's words, "The efforts of the peacemaker, while valuable in worldly and social terms,
                    ultimately must fail because of the nature of this world" (Chance 106-7). </p>
                <p>Even Wealhtheow, with all her virtues, is unable to prevent the later conflagration at Heorot and the
                    death of her entire family. Ultimately, the poet draws such strong associations to highlight not how
                    threatening and dangerous the monsters are but rather how threatening and dangerous human beings
                    are, or at least can be. </p>
                <p>Despite their monstrous nature, the strength, appetite, and terror of the Grendelkin—and even the
                    flames and poison of the dragon—the monsters are ineffective and defeated. The greater, more
                    threatening force in the poem is people; Grendel can terrorize Heorot and Hrothgar, but he does not
                    destroy the hall nor kill Hrothgar and his kin. Heorot awaits destruction in “lathan liges,” the
                    “hateful flames” that will come in the feud between Hrothgar and his son-in-law Ingeld of the
                    Heatho-Bards. Then Hrothulf, Hrothgar’s trusted but treacherous kinsman, will seize the throne from
                    his cousin, Hrothgar’s son. </p>
                <p>Grendel’s mother, as monstrous as she is, is only acting out the approved social code of revenge, a
                    code reaffirmed in the lay of Hildeburh, told the very night Grendel’s mother attacks. Furthermore,
                    while Grendel’s mother is hunted down for seeking revenge for the death of her son, Hildeburh is
                    stripped of all right to such revenge for the death of her son, brother, and husband. </p>
                <p>Likewise, the dragon, for all his destructive abilities and justifiable anger at being robbed, does
                    not destroy the Geats; rather, the Franks, Frisians, and Swedes will obliterate the Geats, as the
                    messenger prophesizes at the end of the poem, which has come to pass, for we still have Franks,
                    Frisians, and Swedes, but no Geats.</p>
                <p>So, what does this have to do with Dr. Shay’s work? </p>
                <p>First, consider that this text is “English,” not “Norse,” and that it was transcribed by a Christian
                    monk. This text marks a transitional period from an honor-based Norse society to a Christian
                    Anglo-Saxon society, and it is the latter’s values that the text champions. <strong>This text, at
                        its heart, is about what it means to be a good king</strong>, which juxtaposes Agamemnon and
                    Beowulf as leaders. It is important to note that the difference between Scyld Scefing and Grendel is
                    not one of violence; they are both wreckers of mead halls. <strong>The difference is one of
                        generosity</strong>. Like Scyld, Beowulf is the ring giver, but he is also generous willing to
                    forfeit his life. This text is about the emergence of a king who serves his people, rather than a
                    king who expects the people to serve him. Beowulf achieves this by performing in a feminine way.
