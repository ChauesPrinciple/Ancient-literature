                <p><em>Beowulf</em> survives in a single medieval manuscript. The manuscript bears no date, and its age
                    must be calculated by analyzing the scribes’ handwriting. Some scholars have suggested that the
                    manuscript was made at the end of the 10th century, others in the early decades of the 11th, perhaps
                    as late as the reign of King Cnut, who ruled England from 1016 until 1035. The most likely time for
                    <em>Beowulf</em> to have been copied is the early 11th century, which makes the manuscript
                    approximately 1,000 years old. Nobody knows for certain when the poem was first composed.
                </p>
                <p>For centuries, the Roman Empire had ruled much of the world, but by the start of the 5th century, the
                    Roman Empire had lost much of its power. Years of civil wars, political chaos, and successful
                    invasions by Germanic tribes, like the Visigoths and Vandals, forced the Romans to abandon lands
                    that were once under their control. The Roman retreat from the island of Britannia allowed several
                    nomadic tribes from Denmark and northern Germany, the Jutes, Saxons, and Angles, to claim this land
                    as their new home. When the first Anglo-Saxons migrated to Britannia, they brought with them their
                    religious beliefs: Norse mythology, wherein they worshipped the gods: Thor, Odin, and Freya, among
                    many others. Evidence of these religious beliefs can still be found in the English names for the
                    first six days of the week, which are all named after gods of Norse mythology.</p>
                <p>The Nordic influence did not outlast the lingering Roman influence, however, and the religion of the
                    Roman Empire was Christianity. Due to the efforts of St. Patrick and other Christian missionaries,
                    the Celts who controlled nearby Ireland and parts of Scotland were predominantly Christian. As
                    Anglo-Saxon cultures spread across the island, marriage between the pagan immigrants and the
                    Christian Celts became common. This intermingling, combined with the missionary work of St.
                    Augustine of Canterbury, resulted in the rapid spread of Christianity among the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
                <p>Because many of the tales and histories of these cultures were spoken or sung and never written down
                    as part of an oral tradition, <em>Beowulf</em> could have been lost or forgotten, which is exactly
                    what happened to many ancient cultures that were once vibrant and flourishing. We know nothing of
                    their languages today, and the stories and histories we have of them are recorded by other cultures.
                    So, what made the Anglo-Saxon language different? Well, we have mentioned that the Anglo-Saxons
                    adopted the religion of the Romans. They were also influenced by other aspects of Roman culture,
                    including the values that the Romans placed on writing. Like the Greeks before them, the Romans were
                    proud of their accomplishments and their culture; men who could record their histories and their
                    stories were held in high esteem. The works of Roman writers Ovid, Horace, Cicero, and Virgil are
                    widely read even today. If not for this Roman influence, the Anglo-Saxon language would likely not
                    have survived.</p>
                <p>There is not, of course, one single person who can be credited with the survival and preservation of
                    the English language, but there are individuals who stand out in history as playing a major role.
                    One of these is Alfred the Great. The king of Wessex, Alfred, gained fame for defeating a Viking
                    invasion in 878, and he remained king until he died in 899. During his reign, Alfred promoted
                    education by requiring literacy of all men who held positions of authority, by establishing a court
                    school where lessons were taught in English, and by writing and translating works into English
                    himself. Partly due to his influence and the value that he placed on education and writing in the
                    common language, Old English was preserved in writing.</p>
                <p>We have over 400 surviving manuscripts written in Anglo-Saxon, or Old English, as we call it. One of
                    these manuscripts, called the <em>Nowell Codex</em>, contains the earliest example of English
                    poetry. That poem is <em>Beowulf</em>.</p>
                <p><em>Beowulf</em> is the oldest epic poem written in English. It was probably written down by monks
                    sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, and <em>Beowulf</em> is also the first epic hero in
                    English literature, even though the character Beowulf is not English himself. He also happens to be
                    the first dragon slayer in English literature. The poem employs many of the literary devices that
                    writers still use today, and it contains some of the earliest English language examples of metaphor,
                    irony, foreshadowing, understatement, alliteration, and more. Furthermore, even though many
                    Christian elements have been added to the original Anglo-Saxon tale, <em>Beowulf</em> gives us a
                    glimpse into the Anglo-Saxon society in the Middle Ages, and it is written in the common language of
                    the Anglo-Saxon people, although it was written in England.</p>
                <p>The story is set in Denmark and Sweden. Since the early Angles and Saxons passed stories down orally,
                    as we saw earlier, <em>Beowulf</em> is likely a great deal older than the period in which it was
                    written down. It gives us insight into the structure of society in everyday life, including the
                    concept of a <em>comitatus</em>, which refers to the bond of loyalty between Germanic rulers and
                    their warriors. The warriors, or thanes in the Anglo-Saxon story, must honor, respect, serve, and
                    defend their ruler to the death. He, in turn, provides them with protection and a share of his
                    wealth. It is a relationship of camaraderie and brotherhood with a strong emphasis on loyalty and
                    kinship.</p>
                <p>When speaking of kinship, we must also speak of lineage. Lineage refers to a person's family line. A
                    hero fights and gains glory not only for himself but for those who went before him and for those who
                    will come after him. He brings honor to his family name. In the poem <em>Beowulf</em>, lineage is
                    important. Beowulf is descended from a brave warrior, while the monster Grendel is of a fatherless
                    race and is referred to as the descendant of Cain. This contrast underscores how important the idea
                    of lineage and family loyalty is to the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
                <p>Concerning lineage, it is also important to understand the sections of Beowulf’s cultural background
                    due to Christian influence. Here is some historical information about <em>Beowulf</em> from a
                    contemporary historian, <strong>Saxo Grammaticus</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thora, who has not stopped grieving over her lost maidenhead, invents a wicked deception to take
                        hideous revenge… she deliberately sends her daughter… down to the shore, instructing her to
                        defile her father in fornication.</li>
                    <li>Helgi (or Halga): Inadvertently marries his daughter Yrse, and the hero Hrolf (Hrothulf) is
                        their offspring. When Yrse learns she has married her father, she runs away and marries the
                        Swedish king Adils (Eagdils). Hrolf attacks Eagdil’s kingdom to avenge his father’s, Halga’s,
                        death at the hand of Eagdil.</li>
                    <li>Yrse and Onela: Onela goes on to kill Beowulf’s lord, Heardred, putting Beowulf on the throne.
                        Beowulf has him killed in revenge.</li>
                    <li>Sigemund and Fitela Digression: Signy seduces her brother (Sigemund) without her brother’s
                        knowledge to produce a warrior capable of avenging their father.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p><em>Beowulf</em> begins with a description of the life of Scyld Scefing, the legendary ancestor of
                    the Scyldings or the Danish royal family. The narrator then lists several descendants of Scyld
                    before getting to Hrothgar, who rules from the hall of Heorot. Beowulf and his thegns arrive at
                    Heorot to assist Hrothgar against the monster Grendel. Grendel is described as a descendant of the
                    biblical Cain (evidence of the Christian layering to the text by the scribe) and is an outsider
                    among men. It is clear, through instances like this, that the poet was Christian writing for a
                    Christian audience. Grendel, for example, is explained by the poet-narrator as a diabolical
                    descendant of Cain, the first murderer, from whose off-spring, according to the Old Testament and
                    Judeo-Christian Apocrypha, arose the various races of giants.</p>
                <p>The narrator explains that the sounds of celebration and joy coming from Heorot agonize Grendel.
                    Grendel begins attacking Heorot on a nightly basis, killing and devouring Hrothgar's warriors.
                    Beowulf hears about Hrothgar’s plight while at home in Geatland. He receives permission from the
                    Geatish king to travel with his warriors to Denmark and fight Grendel. Beowulf and his followers are
                    welcomed by Hrothgar and his wife Wealhtheow. Unferth, one of Hrothgar's warriors, is skeptical
                    about Beowulf's abilities. As the two fling insults at each other, Beowulf recounts the reason he
                    lost a swimming competition: he had to battle some sea monsters.</p>
                <p>Before his battle with Grendel, Beowulf announces he will fight Grendel alone and unarmed, so he
                    pretends to sleep while waiting for Grendel's arrival. When Grendel appears, Beowulf attacks him,
                    and they begin to grapple with each other. When his warriors try to attempt to help, the swords are
                    unable to pierce Grendel's skin. Beowulf ultimately rips Grendel's right arm off, and the monster
                    flees and dies alone. The arm is hung up as a trophy, and Beowulf's victory is celebrated.</p>
                <p>The following night, Grendel's mother arrives. Infuriated by the death of her son, she attacks
                    Heorot. Grendel's mother drags Aeschere, Hrothgar's most trusted warrior, out of the hall and kills
                    him. Beowulf and the other warriors track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. The warrior
                    Unferth presents Beowulf with his sword, Hrunting, and Beowulf prepares with Hrothgar should he be
                    killed in the coming fight. Beowulf then plunges into the water. After sinking for days, he
                    discovers a cave where Grendel and his mother have been living.</p>
                <p>In the cave, Beowulf finds Grendel's body. He engages Grendel's mother in combat, but Unferth's sword
                    cannot pierce her skin. Beowulf eventually finds another magic sword forged by a giant in Grendel’s
                    mothers’ horde and uses it to decapitate Grendel’s mother. He then takes their heads, Grendel and
                    his mother, back to Hrothgar. As a reward, Hrothgar showers Beowulf with gifts, including his
                    ancestral sword, Naegling. <strong>What follows is a lengthy speech by Hrothgar, urging Beowulf to
                        remain humble and to be generous to his thegns</strong>. In essence, Hrothgar <em>is espousing
                        the proper behavior of a successful king and warlord</em>. This would have reflected the values
                    of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy more so than their counterparts in the other early Germanic kingdoms.
                </p>
                <p>Beowulf returns home to the Geats, where his hard-won glory is celebrated and rewarded by his uncle
                    King Hygelac. Fifty years pass, and Beowulf, now an older man, is the king of the Geats when his
                    people are menaced by a fire-breathing dragon. An elderly Beowulf is forced to confront a rampaging
                    dragon. The narrator explains that a slave stole a cup from the dragon's hoard. This prompts the
                    furious beast to leave its lair and attack the countryside. <em>The image of the dragon hoarding its
                        treasure can be contrasted with generous kings and lords who properly reward their warriors and
                        thegns for their faithful military service</em>. Beowulf leads an expedition to the dragon’s
                    barrow, where he intends to fight the creature in single combat (as in the days of his youth and
                    glory). A key difference in this battle, which we will cover further in the analysis, is that for
                    the first time, <em>his warriors</em> (except Wiglaf) <em>run away because they do not believe
                        Beowulf can win</em>. The old king is overmatched but seized by the neck in the dragon's mighty
                    jaws; Beowulf achieves victory with the help of his young kinsman Wiglaf and at the cost of his own
                    life.</p>
                <p>Such a bare summary makes the plot and structure of the poem sound straightforward, but one of the
                    distinctive characteristics of Beowulf is the way the poet skillfully moves back and forth along the
                    linear narrative timeline, <strong>interweaving the main events of the poem with a plethora of inset
                        and secondary historical narratives</strong>. Foreground and background merge in this consummate
                    example of <strong>'interlace' structure</strong> so that the exploits of Beowulf himself are
                    inextricably immersed within a richer background of the heroic legend.</p>
                <p>This is the breakdown of the plot structure into its “principal parts.”</p>

                <p>With the historical digressions removed, this story is not only straightforward, but it probably is
                    also familiar: it directly inspired a famous author, Tolkien. The language that Beowulf employs
                    provides an astonishing level of creative and poetic verbal inventiveness—particularly evident in
                    the use of uniquely-occurring descriptive compound words: <strong>A kenning,</strong> which is a
                    figure of speech in which two words are combined to form a poetic expression that refers to a person
                    or a thing. For example, "whale-road" is a kenning for the sea. <strong>Kennings are most often
                        found in Old Norse and Old English poetry</strong>—and by a layer of verbal formulas and “type
                    scenes,” which recur throughout both the poem and the surviving corpus of Old English poetry.</p>
                <p>Tolkien was not just a fan; he was also a published “critic” of <em>Beowulf</em>. He even wrote his
                    translation of the text. The similarities between Beowulf and Tolkien’s work do not stop there.
                    However, it is more explicit than we might think.</p>

                <p>Speaking of (Lord of the) rings: a "ring-giver" (&lt; OE beag-gefa) is a word with much significance,
                    as it denotes a generous lord.</p>
                <p>The term "ring" here, however, is not the same kind of ring we think of. Our modern English word
                    'ring' comes from an Old English word, hring. A "beag" (modern English for 'ring') is a ring worn
                    around the arm rather than the finger and served somewhat as a monetary unit in early Germanic
                    societies.</p>
