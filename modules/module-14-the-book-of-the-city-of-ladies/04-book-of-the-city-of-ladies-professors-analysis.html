<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">If there had been a bestseller book list in France during the late 14th century, then <i>The Romance of the Rose</i> would have registered as the number one bestseller for years, with translations from the original French into English, Dutch, and Italian. The poem sets out to entertain the reader as the hero tries to woo his beloved. <i>The Romance of the Rose </i>was widely read; it became hugely popular and was highly regarded by laymen and scholars alike. In 1401, a scholar at the French court wrote a treatise supporting the poem. Soon after, he received a letter from a little-known poet; her first letter stated:</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt 0.5in; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">I wish to say, to divulge, and to maintain openly that (saving your good grace) you are in grave error to give such lavish and unjustified praise to Meun’s book- one which could better be called plain idleness than useful work, in my judgment. (Baird 46)</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">The letter went on to say that the poem justified rape, that it deliberately slandered all women, and she asked the secretary himself if he would allow his daughters to be educated by it. Christine de Pizan’s signature was on that letter. By daring to question the representation of women in literature and, by extension, women’s place in society, Christine de Pizan rocketed into public view. For most, Pizan’s letter, penned over six hundred years ago, marks the birth of feminism.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt 0.5in; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">may it not be imputed to me as folly, arrogance, or presumption, that I, a woman, should dare to reproach and call into question so subtle an author, and to diminish the stature of his work, when he alone, a man, has dared to undertake to defame and blame without exception an entire sex. (Baird 63)</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Women and men face double standards, and no, we do not mean just the gender pay gap. We are specifically talking about the different words we use to describe men and women with the same characteristics. While he is described as charismatic, she is often described as bubbly. We would not describe him as an airhead; he is just simple, but she is an airhead. She is bossy, while he is assertive.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">We have seen this throughout this text and this module. Whether it is the women of Gilgamesh’s kingdom, Briseis or Helen of the <i>Iliad</i>, Grendel’s mother, Ophelia, Medea, Alyson, or Scheherazade, these women of the ancient world were subjected to unfair, unjust, and inhumane treatments. The same actions that would have been praised in a man <b>damn a woman</b>; she is loathly and monstrous. Even in the more positive portrayal of women, such as Scheherazade and Alyson, who could reclaim some of their autonomy, the fact remains that a male agenda represents them. Combatting this misrepresentation is one of the primary purposes of Feminism: to create a feminine language, by women, for women.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">For instance, the writer Ben Black found that the verbs most associated with the pronoun “she” in classic fiction are: shivered, wept, murmured, screamed, and married. The most commonly associated with “he” are: muttered, grinned, shouted, chuckled, and killed. Academics from the University of Illinois and the University of California analyzed over 100,000 works of fiction written between 1800 and 2010. They used an algorithm to determine the character’s gender, based only on the language used in descriptions and dialogue. These predictions were right 75% of the time for books written around 1800, but that falls to just about 65% of books written around 2000. The vocabulary used to describe women and men is becoming more blurred between genders; stereotypes like feisty are less common than they used to be. However, it is essential to remember that feminists like Christine de Pizan were not attempting to blur the lines between genders but establish them equally.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Feminism is a <b>conflict theory</b> that suggests that power in society is divided based on gender. Feminists suggest the patriarchal oppression of women exists in all sections of society: employment, home education, and media. They also suggest that the study of sociology has been almost entirely male-oriented. In other words, male theorists focused on the issues that are of concern to males. Indeed, early Feminism focused on studying female issues and the representations of women in society. However, Feminism evolved to deal with contemporary issues surrounding gender differences. This movement has a particular focus in contemporary society on the intersectionality of women’s experiences, examining differences based upon social class, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, age, religion, and geographical location, which gives Feminism a broad appeal when looking at our gender differences.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Christine de Pizan’s ability to predict the intellectual foundation of the Feminist movement is what makes her work so extraordinary. Pizan uses real historical examples in <i>The Book of the City of Ladies</i> to show how hypocritical men have unjustly oppressed women. The book is a chronicle of historic women who have contributed to society. Christine covers women as wives, mothers, and leaders; she speaks of women in the legal system, the social system, and marriage. She cleverly disguises her insight under three personas Lady Reason, Lady Rectitude, and Lady Justice. In doing so, she even manages to reclaim some of the loathly women that have been framed as monstrous, like Medea, who is condemned for acting in the same manner as countless men before her.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">By proving her point, she denounces the credibility of some well-known men like Aristotle and Ovid for their views on women. An example of this is when Christine asked Lady Reason why Ovid attacked women so much in his books. Reason replies that Ovid was a man who led a promiscuous life with many women during his youth. Along the way, Ovid leads “others through his acts and words” to lead a life like his. His actions finally led the Romans to exile him for his promiscuity. Ovid had friends who managed to get his exile removed. However, when he stepped out, he went back to his old way of life, which led to his castration, and since he could not lead the pleasurable life he wanted to live, he began to attack women to bring everyone down to his level of misery.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Pizan’s book is a tangible demonstration of women’s accomplishments and their capability to act morally and prudently. It is a direct response to the devastating accounts about women that she has read, each of which cast doubt on women’s intellectual abilities, chastity, and faith in God. Nevertheless, without erasing the focus in Pizan’s work, we can also see a fundamental philosophical question in her approach: how do we know what the truth is, and how do we distinguish essence from—as Plato would say—opinions about it?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Christine de Pizan’s answer intriguingly anticipates another significant movement. Her methods are similar to the empirical epistemological searches of sixteenth-century Protestantism and seventeenth-century New Science: searching for truth by collecting data. Her examples of accomplished and admirable women typify what E. J. Richards calls “medieval notions of universal history” (264, n. II.22.2). Christine mixes figures from recent history, ancient history, mythology, the Bible, fictional accounts, and contemporary women. Fictional or factual, all her examples take on a mythic value, defying other authors’ claims of women’s inferiority. She sustains her pro-female position within Christianity. She claims that Christian writing includes reverence for the Virgin Mary and female saints and stands against misogyny. She also highlights the logical fallacies in misogynist reasoning. The triple woman framework invokes the Trinity, as well. Reason, Rectitude, and Justice, Christine’s three architects, also demonstrate what values and capacities are inherently human, what ties human beings to God, and what is inherently divine.</span></p>
