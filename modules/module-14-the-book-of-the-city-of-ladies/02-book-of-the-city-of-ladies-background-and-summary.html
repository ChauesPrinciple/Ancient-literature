                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Christine de Pizan was born around 1364 in Italy. Her mother was the daughter of a councilor, and her
                    father was a professor at the University of Bologna. He was appointed to the Court of Charles the
                    Fifth in France, so the family moved to Paris. In Paris, their surname mutated from Pisano to Pizan.
                    Early on, even though most women were never educated, her father was adamant that Christine receive
                    an education. When she was fifteen, Christine married Etienne du Castela, a scholar and nobleman.
                    The couple was still newlywed when in 1380, King Charles the Fifth died. Charles the Sixth was a
                    child when he became King, and his uncle, Phillip of Burgundy, advised him.</p>

                <p>Phillip also preceded to drain the Royal coffers. Christine's father continued to work with the new
                    King, but his income was vastly decreased. He died around 1385. In the end, Christine's husband
                    became head of the family. Nevertheless, five years later, in 1390, Etienne died while away on
                    business with the King. Christine de Pizan was 25 years old with three young children and a mother
                    to support. She had no money and no prospects. She tried to get access to her husband's money, but
                    the government refused her access because she was a woman. Facing destitution, Pizan began writing.
                    She wrote poetry to the memory of her husband. French and English aristocrats received her work
                    well. Now she could look after her family. <strong>Christine de Pizan was the first professional
                        writer.</strong></p>

                <p>One day Pizan came across a treatise praising a particular poem, <em>The Romance of the Rose</em>,
                    not realizing that her world was about to change forever. <em>The Romance of the Rose</em> is a very
                    long poem, but the following short quotation sums up the attitude towards women:</p>

                <blockquote
                    style="background: #f8d7da; border-left: 4px solid #721c24; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; font-style: italic;">
                    <p style="margin: 0;">"All women are, will be, or have been whores by action or intention."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Pizan argued against <strong>the generalization in the poem</strong>. The poem defamed an entire sex,
                    without exception, which placed her in a very similar situation to Alyson and Scheherazade. She also
                    pointed out several inconsistencies and fallacies committed by the author's rhetoric. For instance,
                    while <em>The Romance of the Roses</em> accuses all women of immorality, most women's actual actions
                    and conditions directly contradict this portrayal of women. Pizan's <em>published</em> response to
                    <em>The Romance of the Rose</em> began the quarrel of the Rose and a literary debate that marked a
                    turning point in literature and history. In the debate, Christine de Pizan exchanged heated
                    arguments with intellectuals over the nature of the poem, gaining allies and enemies along the way.
                    The quarrel of the Rose lasted for years and culminated in the accusation of blasphemy, not against
                    the author of the Romance that defamed women, as we may have come to expect, but against Pizan's
                    effort to assess it.
                </p>

                <p>Pizan continued the debate in her next book, <em>The Book of the City of Ladies</em>. In it, she
                    created a symbolic city where women were defended and appreciated, and the book became a forum to
                    speak on issues of consequence to women.</p>

                <p>Interestingly, as a literary construct, Pizan's utopian city anticipated Thomas More's
                    <em>Utopia</em> by over one hundred years and Francis Bacon's <em>New Atlantis</em> by over two
                    hundred. After being thrust into the medieval public eye following the quarrel of the Rose,
                    Christine de Pizan wrote prolifically, authoring at least fifteen significant manuscripts in about
                    six years, not including minor essays and poems. Most notably, Philip of Burgundy commissioned her
                    to write the official biography of his deceased brother, King Charles the Fifth. In 1418, Pizan left
                    Paris and joined her daughter at a convent, and stopped writing. The notable exception was a single
                    poem in 1429 that celebrated the success of Joan of Arc. She died in obscurity around 1430.
                </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>As the narrator of the text, Pizan describes that as she sat in her study reading <em>The
                        Lamentations of Matheolus</em>, a 13th century invective against women and the sanctity of
                    marriage. His tirade against the female sex left her feeling confused and dejected by the depiction
                    of women, and she fell into a trance. Pizan frames <em>The Book of the City of Ladies</em> as a
                    <strong>dream vision</strong>. In this trance, three personified virtues—Reason, Rectitude, and
                    Justice—arrive and tell her that God has chosen her to build a metaphorical City, wherein all
                    virtuous women can find sanctitude.
                </p>

                <p>They direct in all the steps for building such a utopia, each step of which is also metaphorical.
                    This City of Ladies will house a worthy group of heroines to protect women against attacks. Each of
                    the three virtues teaches Pizan about the achievements of great women throughout history, including
                    reclaiming some of the "loathly women" we have studied in this collection. There are also scholars,
                    warriors, and other great women. Pizan constructs the city's walls from this feminine perspective.
                    In a metanarrative move that Don Quixote would be proud of, Pizan, through the <em>Book of the City
                        of Ladies</em>, constructs a new perspective of history and makes it physical through the book
                    itself. This type of text belongs to the <strong>biographical catalog</strong> genre, which
                    celebrates the lives of famous figures from history and mythology.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0;">In <strong>Part I</strong>, <strong>Reason</strong> presents women (mainly
                        pagan) famous for their courage, artistry, or inventiveness.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 1rem 0 0 0;">In <strong>Part II</strong>, <strong>Rectitude</strong> presents
                        Hebrew and Christian ladies renowned for their prophetic gifts, chastity, or love for their
                        families or fellow citizens.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 1rem 0 0 0;">Lastly, in <strong>Part III</strong>, <strong>Justice</strong>
                        recounts the lives of female saints crowned with glory for their steadfastness.</p>

                <p>The text is indebted to <em>De Claris Mulieribus</em> (Concerning Famous Women) by the Tuscan author
                    Giovanni Boccaccio, written in c. 1375.</p>
