                <h1>Major Projects</h1>
                <p>This semester, you will have two large projects to complete. One is a literary analysis paper. The
                    other is to create an anthology. These may use the same theme and one of the same texts.&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Literary Analysis</h2>
                <p>What is a literary analysis? The word analysis means to break something into its parts. For an
                    analysis then, you examine the parts of a piece of literature through a specific lens. For example,
                    in this class, we look at&nbsp;<em>Medea</em>&nbsp;through the lens of gender roles. To write an
                    analysis, you would then only choose the parts of the story that fit that theme and discuss
                    them.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This assignment asks you to pick a theme (like gender roles in the example above). We explore a
                    different theme nearly every single week in this class, but you can pick your own if you want. Then
                    you must pick a text we have read in this class to examine. Search that text for events or actions
                    or quotes that fit that theme. As you can imagine, to write a literary analysis, you must be really
                    familiar with the text.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In your paper, use specific examples and quotations from your text to prove to me that your text is
                    about the theme you have chosen.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The last part of this assignment asks you to then connect your text and your theme to a contemporary
                    issue. For example, if you are discussing gender roles in&nbsp;<em>Madea</em>, how does that apply
                    to the world today? Are we still facing the same issues?&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You must use at least one outside scholarly source in this paper to back up what you are
                    saying.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The full directions for this assignment, example assignments, and additional information can be found
                    on the <a href="04-literary-analysis-essay.html">Literary Analysis Essay</a> page.</p>
                <h2>Anthology&nbsp;</h2>
                <p>What is an anthology? An anthology is a book that contains multiple works written by multiple
                    different authors. Typically, these are organized by theme. For this assignment, you may want to use
                    the same theme you used for the literary analysis.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Now pretend you are making a book (anthology) based on this theme. What texts would you include?
                    Obviously, you would include the text from your literary analysis, but what others? Would you
                    include other texts from this class? Then define the term "text" loosely; we aren't really making a
                    book; we are pretending, so we can do cool things like put songs or video games or movies in our
                    anthology. What outside texts fit your theme? You need ten texts for this assignment.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE: This is NOT an essay.</strong></p>
                <p>First, you need to create a title page. What is the name of your anthology? Who wrote it? (you!)</p>
                <p>Second, create a table of contents (just like you'd see in the front of any anthology!). This page
                    needs to list your ten texts and shows how they're organized.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Third, write the preface. This should be three pages, and it should show how your ten texts relate to
                    your theme and why you organized them the way you did.</p>
